- text: "Why did the DBA bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud database."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of 'cloud' in cloud databases, creating incongruity between the abstract concept of cloud computing and the physical object of a ladder."
  rating: 3

- text: "I told my database it was being too relational. Now it won't join me for lunch."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke that plays on 'relational' databases and 'join' operations, applying them to social situations, creating humor through the personification of database concepts."
  rating: 7

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- 0 rows returned."
  explanation: "This SQL query joke uses the technical format of a database query to make a commentary about users lacking knowledge, with the punchline being the comment showing no results were found."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't databases ever get lonely? They're always in relationships."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the double meaning of 'relationships' - both as database table relationships and human social connections, creating humor through the incongruity of applying human emotions to databases."
  rating: 6

- text: "My database administrator is so pessimistic, he always expects a rollback."
  explanation: "A play on the database concept of 'rollback' (undoing transactions) applied to personality traits, suggesting someone who expects things to go wrong and need to be undone."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked my database for commitment. It gave me a transaction instead."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'commit' in databases (finalizing transactions) versus personal commitment, highlighting the difference between technical and emotional concepts."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the SQL query go to therapy? It had too many inner joins and couldn't find closure."
  explanation: "This combines database terminology (INNER JOIN) with psychological concepts (finding closure), creating humor by applying database operations to emotional problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "A NoSQL database walks into a bar. Sees a table. Leaves."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the fundamental difference between NoSQL and relational databases - NoSQL doesn't use traditional tables, so the database literally avoids them even in a social setting."
  rating: 9

- text: "My database has trust issues. Every time I try to connect, it asks for credentials."
  explanation: "Personifies database security measures as psychological trust issues, creating humor by applying human emotional problems to routine technical security procedures."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why was the database administrator always calm during disasters? He had a solid backup plan and knew how to handle a crash."
  explanation: "A multi-layered joke using 'backup plan' (both database backups and contingency planning) and 'crash' (system failure and emotional composure), showing how database concepts mirror life skills."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to teach my database about boundaries. Now everything's in separate schemas."
  explanation: "Uses the database concept of schemas (organizational structures) as a metaphor for personal boundaries, creating humor through the literal implementation of an abstract concept."
  rating: 7

- text: "DELETE FROM problems WHERE solution IS NOT NULL; -- This query has been running for 3 years."
  explanation: "A meta-joke about problem-solving that uses SQL syntax to express the universal experience of trying to eliminate problems, with the punchline suggesting it's an impossible task that never completes."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the database go on a diet? It had too much bloat and needed to optimize its indexes."
  explanation: "Combines database performance issues (bloat, index optimization) with human health concerns, creating humor by treating database maintenance as a wellness program."
  rating: 5

- text: "My database and I are in couples counseling. The therapist says we have communication issues - apparently I keep dropping the connection."
  explanation: "An extended metaphor treating database connectivity problems as relationship issues, with 'dropping the connection' working both technically and emotionally."
  rating: 7

- text: "A database administrator's favorite pickup line: 'Are you a primary key? Because you're unique and I want to build my whole relationship around you.'"
  explanation: "A nerdy pickup line that actually demonstrates deep understanding of database design - primary keys are unique identifiers that other tables reference, making it a surprisingly romantic database metaphor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer break up with MongoDB? She said he was too non-committal with his schemas."
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke playing on MongoDB's schemaless nature (flexibility in data structure) applied to relationship commitment, with the added layer that 'schema' sounds like 'scheme' or plan."
  rating: 8

- text: "I accidentally dropped the production database. My boss asked if I could restore it. I said 'FROM WHERE?'"
  explanation: "A brilliant multi-level joke: 'DROP' and 'RESTORE FROM' are SQL commands, but the punchline also works as a genuine confused response, plus it's a SQL syntax joke since you can't restore without specifying a backup location."

- text: "Two DBAs walk into a NoSQL bar. They leave because they couldn't find any tables to sit at. One says to the other: 'I heard this place has great scalability, but terrible consistency.' The other replies: 'Eventually, we'll find somewhere.'"
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke about the CAP theorem and eventual consistency in NoSQL databases. It works on multiple levels: NoSQL databases don't use tables, they sacrifice consistency for scalability, and 'eventually' references 'eventual consistency' - a key NoSQL concept."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: 'Mind if I JOIN you?' The tables reply: 'Sure, but only if you can relate.' The query thinks for a moment and says: 'Don't worry, I'm very INNER-directed, though I can be LEFT or RIGHT depending on the situation. I promise I won't CROSS you unless it's absolutely necessary.' One table whispers to the other: 'This guy has no FOREIGN KEY to success.' The query overhears and storms out, muttering: 'NULL points for hospitality!'"
  explanation: "An elaborate joke that weaves together multiple database concepts: JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS), relationships between tables, foreign keys, and NULL values. Each line contains a database pun while maintaining a coherent narrative about social rejection, making it funny on both technical and story levels."

- text: "A database administrator dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says: 'Before you enter, I need to check your credentials.' The DBA replies: 'Sure, but can I see your SSL certificate first? I don't trust unencrypted connections.' St. Peter sighs: 'We've been running on faith-based authentication for millennia.' The DBA shakes his head: 'That explains all the security breaches. You know Satan was originally an INNER angel until someone forgot to revoke his privileges after the termination. Classic privilege escalation attack. And don't even get me started on the replication issues between the Old and New Testaments - totally inconsistent data models.' St. Peter checks his notes: 'It says here you once deleted production on a Friday afternoon.' The DBA protests: 'That was ONE time, and I had backups! Well, I THOUGHT I had backups. The backup job had been failing silently for six months, but nobody monitored it.' St. Peter nods knowingly: 'Welcome to hell - I mean, heaven. Same thing for DBAs. Your eternal punishment is maintaining a database with no documentation, no backups, written by a developer who's been dead for 40 years, with a million stored procedures named like SP_PROC_1, SP_PROC_2, and one just called TEMP that's actually critical to the business.' The DBA's face goes pale: 'Is... is there at least an ER diagram?' St. Peter laughs: 'There WAS one, but it was stored IN the database... which is currently corrupted.' The DBA falls to his knees: 'I should have been nicer to developers!'"
  explanation: "This is an epic, multi-layered narrative joke that combines theology with database administration. It works on numerous levels: authentication and security concepts applied to heaven's gates, the classic DBA nightmare of production deletions, the universal terror of failed backups, poor documentation and naming conventions, the Friday afternoon deployment curse, privilege management failures, and the ultimate horror scenario of maintaining an undocumented legacy system. The joke builds tension through increasingly relatable DBA nightmares, uses technical terminology accurately, and ends with a moral lesson delivered through the ultimate punishment - every DBA's worst fear made eternal. The Satan privilege escalation joke and the Testament data model inconsistency are particularly clever theological-technical mashups."
