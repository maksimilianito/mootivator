- text: "My code has bugs. Well, at least it has features."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common developer excuse of calling bugs 'features.' The humor comes from the self-aware admission that the code is problematic, but the programmer is trying to reframe it positively through wordplay."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the bug go to therapy? It had commitment issues."
  explanation: "This uses personification of a software bug and plays on the double meaning of 'commit' - both in relationships and in version control systems. The joke suggests bugs are unstable and don't stick around in the codebase properly."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of testing code directly in live production environments, which is a common developer mistake that leads to bugs."

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
  explanation: "This joke illustrates the difference between testing edge cases and real-world usage. QA tests all the technical possibilities, but real users always find unexpected ways to break software by doing something completely normal that wasn't anticipated."
  rating: 10

- text: "My software doesn't have bugs, it develops random features."
  explanation: "This is a playful reframing of software defects as spontaneous innovations. The humor lies in the absurd notion that unpredictable behavior is actually a positive attribute, which is the opposite of good software design."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because bugs are attracted to light."
  explanation: "This joke combines the literal meaning of bugs (insects attracted to light) with software bugs, suggesting that using dark mode will somehow prevent software errors - a humorous superstition."
  rating: 7

- text: "There are two ways to write error-free programs. Only the third one works."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through logical impossibility - mentioning two ways but then referencing a third. It also suggests that even the 'correct' approaches don't actually work, reflecting the reality that truly bug-free software is nearly impossible."
  rating: 8

- text: "I stayed up all night debugging. Turns out it was a feature I implemented yesterday."
  explanation: "This joke captures the frustration of hunting for a bug only to realize you're the one who created it. The humor comes from the self-inflicted nature of the problem and the wasted effort."
  rating: 7

- text: "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it."
  explanation: "This is a pun on 'console.log()' in JavaScript and the act of consoling someone emotionally. It's a simple wordplay that works on the double meaning of 'console' in programming versus emotional support."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code is like a mystery novel. Every chapter introduces new bugs, and the ending never makes sense."
  explanation: "This joke compares debugging to reading a confusing story where problems keep appearing unexpectedly. The humor lies in the frustration of code that becomes increasingly complex and incomprehensible over time."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer quit? The bugs kept multiplying like they were in a loop."
  explanation: "This combines the biological concept of reproduction with programming loops, suggesting that bugs reproduce themselves infinitely. It plays on the feeling that fixing one bug creates two more."
  rating: 6

- text: "I found a bug in my code from 2015. We've been in a committed relationship ever since."
  explanation: "This personifies a long-standing bug as a romantic partner, humorously suggesting that some bugs become permanent fixtures in codebases. The 'committed relationship' implies the developer has given up trying to fix it."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer, the victim, and the weapon."
  explanation: "This joke captures the existential reality of debugging - the programmer created the bug, suffers from it, and is also the tool that caused it. The multi-role metaphor highlights the self-inflicted nature of programming problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my manager the bug was a feature. He told me unemployment was a feature too."
  explanation: "This joke escalates the common 'it's a feature, not a bug' excuse by having the manager turn the same logic against the developer. The humor comes from the reversal and the consequence of trying to avoid responsibility."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't bugs ever go to parties? They prefer to crash systems instead."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'crash' - both social gatherings and system failures. The personification of bugs as antisocial entities that prefer causing technical problems creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "I've achieved perfect code. It has exactly 0 bugs. Mainly because it has 0 lines."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the logical truth that empty code cannot have bugs, satirizing the pursuit of perfection. The humor lies in the absurd solution of not writing any code at all to avoid bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "A programmer's spouse says: 'While you're out, buy some milk.' The programmer never returns."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the 'while' loop in programming. Since the condition 'while you're out' remains true as long as they're outside, they're stuck in an infinite loop and can never come home. It's a clever application of programming logic to real life."
  rating: 9

- text: "99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, patch it around, 127 bugs in the code."
  explanation: "This parodies the '99 Bottles of Beer' song but shows how fixing one bug often creates more problems. The increase from 99 to 127 is humorously dramatic and reflects the frustrating reality that bug fixes can introduce new issues."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally fixed that bug that's been haunting me for weeks. Now I'm terrified to find out what I broke in the process."
  explanation: "This captures the anxiety that comes after fixing a major bug - the fear that the solution has created new problems elsewhere. The humor comes from the paranoid but often justified worry that accompanies any significant code change."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It just has undocumented features that coincidentally cause the program to crash, delete data, and occasionally achieve sentience."
  explanation: "This joke takes the 'bugs are features' excuse to an absurd extreme by listing increasingly catastrophic consequences as mere 'undocumented features.' The escalation to achieving sentience adds a surreal element that makes the rationalization ridiculous."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote a program to help me find bugs in my code. Now I have two problems: the original bugs and the bugs in my debugging program. So I wrote another program to debug the debugger. I'm now three layers deep and considering a career in gardening."
  explanation: "This joke illustrates the recursive nightmare of debugging tools that themselves need debugging. The escalation and the ultimate surrender to pursue gardening instead creates humor through the absurdity of the situation and the relatable desire to escape programming entirely."
