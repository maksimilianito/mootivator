- text: "I tried reading the MIT License, but it was too permissive—it let me fall asleep."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'permissive' - MIT License is known for being a permissive open-source license (allowing almost anything), while also suggesting the license text was so boring it 'permitted' the reader to doze off. It's a simple wordplay on licensing terminology."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer choose Apache 2.0? Because GPL was too committed to the relationship."
  explanation: "This uses the metaphor of romantic relationships to explain licensing differences. GPL requires 'commitment' through copyleft provisions (derivative works must also be GPL), while Apache 2.0 is more casual, allowing proprietary derivatives. The joke relies on understanding these licensing philosophies."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code is like my jokes—both released under 'No Rights Reserved' because nobody wants them anyway."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor combining Creative Commons licensing (CC0/Public Domain) with the programmer's insecurity. The 'No Rights Reserved' is a real licensing term, making the joke work on both the technical and emotional level."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a lawyer's favorite programming language? Legalese++, compiled with the GNU General Public Lawsuit."
  explanation: "This mashes up GPL (GNU General Public License) with legal complexity, suggesting lawyers have their own programming language. It plays on the reputation of GPL being legally complex and the C++ naming convention."
  rating: 7

- text: "I put my code under GPL. Now even I need permission to understand it."
  explanation: "This jokes about GPL's complexity and the common programmer experience of not understanding their own old code. The irony is that GPL actually gives you all permissions, but the joke suggests even the author is confused by the legal text."
  rating: 5

- text: "Open source: where you're free to use the software, but enslaved to reading the documentation."
  explanation: "This plays on the concept of 'free' in open source (free as in freedom) while highlighting the practical burden of poor or extensive documentation. It's an incongruity between the promise of freedom and the reality of complexity."
  rating: 8

- text: "A developer walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender says, 'That'll be free, but you have to share any improvements to your liver with the community.'"
  explanation: "This personifies GPL's copyleft provisions in an absurd everyday scenario. Just as GPL requires sharing modifications, the bartender requires sharing biological improvements—an impossible and humorous extension of open-source philosophy."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't proprietary software developers go to confession? They're already bound by NDAs."
  explanation: "This compares religious confession with Non-Disclosure Agreements, suggesting that proprietary developers can't even confess their sins because everything is secret. It's a commentary on the secretive nature of proprietary software culture."
  rating: 7

- text: "I released my code as 'beerware'—you can do anything with it, but if we meet, you owe me a beer. I've been sober for three years."
  explanation: "Beerware is a real humorous license. The joke's punchline reveals nobody has actually used the code (or met the developer), which is why they're still sober. It's self-deprecating humor about software that nobody wants."
  rating: 9

- text: "Creative Commons: because 'Some Rights Reserved' is the relationship status of software licensing."
  explanation: "This compares Creative Commons licensing to Facebook relationship statuses, suggesting that 'Some Rights Reserved' is like 'It's Complicated.' It captures the middle ground between fully proprietary and fully open."
  rating: 6

- text: "My manager asked me to explain our software licenses. Three hours later, he said, 'Just tell me: can we use it?' I said, 'Let me consult the license.' He retired."
  explanation: "This story-format joke exaggerates the complexity of license interpretation. The escalation from a simple question to retirement highlights how frustrating and time-consuming license compliance can be in real corporate environments."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the startup choose MIT License? Because they wanted their code to have commitment issues."
  explanation: "MIT License doesn't require derivative works to maintain the same license (unlike GPL), so it has 'commitment issues' in terms of not forcing long-term licensing obligations. This personifies licenses with human relationship characteristics."
  rating: 6

- text: "I forked a GPL project and kept my changes private. My lawyer says I need a priest, not an attorney."
  explanation: "This joke treats GPL violation as a moral sin rather than a legal issue. The humor comes from elevating a licensing violation to the level of spiritual transgression, playing on the zealotry of some open-source advocates."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between proprietary software and a black box? Black boxes eventually get opened after a crash."
  explanation: "This dark humor compares proprietary software's closed nature to airplane black boxes. The twist is that even black boxes are more transparent than proprietary code, since they're opened after disasters. It's a commentary on software opacity."
  rating: 9

- text: "A BSD license walks into a bar. An MIT license says, 'You look familiar.' BSD replies, 'Yeah, everyone thinks we're the same person, but I have a drinking problem with that advertising clause.' MIT says, 'I dropped that years ago.'"
  explanation: "This personifies two similar permissive licenses, referencing the historical 'advertising clause' in original BSD licenses that was problematic. It's insider humor about licensing history and the subtle differences between similar licenses."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code is dual-licensed: GPL for people I like, and AGPL for people who ask too many questions."
  explanation: "AGPL is considered even more restrictive than GPL (covering network use). The joke suggests using licensing as passive-aggressive revenge, which is absurd but captures the perception of AGPL as the 'nuclear option' of copyleft."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers fear the WTFPL? Because it's the only license that accurately describes their reaction to their own code six months later."
  explanation: "WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License) is a real, profane license. The joke connects this to the universal experience of developers not understanding their old code, making the license name accidentally autobiographical."
  rating: 9

- text: "I tried to read the Oracle license agreement. I'm now legally obligated to name my firstborn 'Enterprise Edition.'"
  explanation: "This exaggerates Oracle's reputation for aggressive licensing and complex terms. The absurd consequence (naming a child after a software edition) satirizes how invasive and binding some proprietary licenses feel to developers."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a programmer who reads every license before using a library? Unemployed. What do you call one who reads none? CTO."
  explanation: "This two-part joke uses superiority theory to mock both extremes: the impractical perfectionist who can't get work done, and the reckless executive who ignores legal risks. It's a commentary on the impossible balance of due diligence versus productivity."
  rating: 10

- text: "A GPL zealot, an MIT pragmatist, and a proprietary developer walk into a bar. Only the proprietary developer can afford drinks because he actually monetized his code. The GPL zealot says, 'But at what cost to your soul?' The MIT developer says, 'You guys are getting attribution?'"
  explanation: "This three-person joke captures the philosophical differences between licensing approaches: GPL's ideological purity, proprietary's commercial success, and MIT's minimal-expectation realism. Each punchline reveals their different priorities and disappointments."
  rating: 10

- text: "I released my project under the 'Schrödinger License'—it's simultaneously open source and proprietary until a lawyer observes it, at which point it collapses into a lawsuit."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines quantum mechanics (Schrödinger's cat) with licensing ambiguity. It satirizes projects with unclear or contradictory licensing, and how legal observation (lawyer review) forces a definitive state—usually a problematic one. It's meta-humor about licensing uncertainty."
