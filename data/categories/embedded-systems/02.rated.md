- text: "My IoT device has 2KB of RAM. That's not a constraint, that's a haiku."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the extreme memory limitations of embedded systems. By comparing the minuscule 2KB RAM to a haiku (a very short form of poetry), it highlights how resource-constrained programming requires expressing functionality in the absolute minimum space possible."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the embedded programmer break up with their partner? Too many dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'dependencies' - both the technical concept of software dependencies (which are problematic in resource-constrained systems) and relationship dependencies. Embedded systems developers try to minimize external dependencies to keep code size small."
  rating: 7

- text: "Embedded systems: where 'Hello World' takes three weeks and 500 lines of configuration."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the complexity of embedded development, where even simple programs require extensive setup, hardware initialization, and configuration code - contrasting sharply with high-level programming where 'Hello World' is typically one line."
  rating: 8

- text: "I optimized my code from 101% memory usage to 99%. Now it almost works."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurd precision required in embedded systems where you literally cannot exceed 100% memory usage. The joke is that even after optimization, being at 99% still leaves almost no room for the program to actually function properly."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's an embedded programmer's favorite exercise? Stack overflow prevention."
  explanation: "A play on 'stack overflow' which in embedded systems is a catastrophic error due to limited stack memory, compared to the website StackOverflow. The joke treats preventing this technical problem as if it were a physical exercise routine."
  rating: 6

- text: "My microcontroller's idea of multitasking is doing one thing while forgetting another."
  explanation: "This personifies the limitations of simple microcontrollers that lack true multitasking capabilities or sufficient memory to handle multiple tasks, often requiring careful task scheduling and priority management."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't embedded programmers tell secrets? They're always worried about buffer overflows."
  explanation: "Buffer overflows are security vulnerabilities where data exceeds allocated memory. The joke applies this technical concern to personal life, suggesting embedded programmers are paranoid about information exceeding its intended boundaries."
  rating: 6

- text: "I spent six hours debugging. The problem was a missing semicolon. The semicolon was in the hardware."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke plays on the boundary between software and hardware in embedded systems, where bugs can exist in either domain. The impossibility of a 'hardware semicolon' emphasizes the sometimes inexplicable nature of embedded debugging."
  rating: 9

- text: "IoT stands for 'Internet of Things That Should Have Remained Offline.'"
  explanation: "A cynical redefinition of IoT that comments on security issues and the questionable necessity of connecting everyday objects to the internet, often creating more problems than solutions."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call an embedded system with 1MB of RAM? Luxury."
  explanation: "This uses irony to highlight how constrained embedded systems typically are. What would be considered absurdly small in modern computing (1MB) is treated as extravagant in the embedded world, where kilobytes are more common."
  rating: 7

- text: "My firmware update bricked my toaster. Now it's just a bread warmer with trust issues."
  explanation: "This jokes about IoT device failures where firmware updates can permanently disable devices ('bricking'). The personification of the toaster having 'trust issues' adds absurdist humor to a real frustration with smart appliances."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the embedded programmer go to therapy? Watchdog timer kept resetting their progress."
  explanation: "Watchdog timers automatically reset systems that appear frozen, which can be frustrating during development. The joke applies this technical reset to psychological progress, creating a metaphor for feeling like you're constantly starting over."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my smart fridge for ice. It sent me a firmware update and a privacy policy revision."
  explanation: "This satirizes the over-complication of IoT devices that perform simple tasks but require complex software infrastructure, often prioritizing updates and legal compliance over basic functionality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Real programmers don't need an OS. They toggle bits with their minds and willpower."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the bare-metal nature of embedded programming where developers often work without an operating system, directly manipulating hardware registers. The absurd escalation to mental bit-toggling celebrates this low-level control."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between an embedded system and a teenager? The embedded system eventually responds to interrupts."
  explanation: "This uses the technical concept of hardware interrupts (signals that demand immediate attention) to create a humorous comparison with unresponsive teenagers, playing on both technical and parental frustrations."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, it's in production. On a satellite. That launched yesterday."
  explanation: "This escalates the stakes of embedded systems testing by placing untested code in the most unrecoverable situation possible - space. It satirizes poor testing practices while acknowledging that embedded systems often can't be easily updated after deployment."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code is so optimized, I removed all the vowels from my variable names. Now I cn't rd nythng."
  explanation: "This takes the embedded programming practice of using short variable names (to save memory) to an absurd extreme, creating a self-defeating optimization where the code becomes unmaintainable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the microcontroller go to school? To learn how to handle its interrupts without having a breakdown."
  explanation: "This personifies a microcontroller dealing with interrupt handling (a complex aspect of embedded programming) as if it were a student learning stress management, creating a relatable metaphor for the complexity of real-time systems."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my boss we need more memory. He said 'Just delete some variables.' I'm now storing everything in register names and crying in assembly."
  explanation: "This escalates through increasingly desperate optimization techniques, ending with the absurd and painful reality of working in assembly language with no memory to spare. It captures the resource-constrained embedded developer's nightmare."
  rating: 9

- text: "An embedded programmer walks into a bar. There's no bar. They're hallucinating from pointer arithmetic on a system with no memory protection."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated anti-joke that subverts the 'walks into a bar' format by explaining the setup as a hallucination caused by memory corruption - a real danger in embedded systems without memory protection units."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally achieved zero-latency response in my embedded system. Unfortunately, it now responds before I ask it to do anything. The toaster has become sentient and passive-aggressive."
  explanation: "This takes the embedded systems goal of minimal latency to an absurd extreme where the system responds with negative latency (before the request), then escalates to AI sentience and human-like passive aggression, creating multiple layers of absurdist humor about IoT devices."
