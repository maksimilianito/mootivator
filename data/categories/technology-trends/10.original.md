```yaml
- text: "I just upgraded to the latest framework. It's already deprecated."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the frustratingly rapid pace of technology change, where new frameworks and tools become outdated almost immediately after adoption, highlighting the constant pressure developers face to stay current."

- text: "Why did the startup pivot? Their original idea became obsolete during the pitch meeting."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to comment on how quickly technology trends change, suggesting that even the time it takes to present an idea is enough for it to become outdated in the fast-moving tech world."

- text: "My New Year's resolution was to learn the hottest new JavaScript framework. I'm still deciding which one from January."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the overwhelming proliferation of JavaScript frameworks and how quickly new ones emerge, making it nearly impossible to choose before another 'hot' option appears."

- text: "I finally mastered React. Now everyone's saying 'React is so 2015.'"
  explanation: "This reflects the frustration of investing time to learn a technology only to have it be considered outdated by the time you achieve proficiency, a common experience in rapidly evolving tech fields."

- text: "The only constant in technology is that your skills from last year are now 'legacy experience.'"
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the term 'legacy' (typically meaning old, outdated systems) to describe how quickly technical knowledge becomes obsolete, turning expertise into something that sounds outdated rather than valuable."

- text: "Why don't developers write their resumes in stone anymore? The tech stack would be obsolete before the chisel dried."
  explanation: "This uses absurdist imagery to emphasize how impossibly fast technology changes, suggesting that even ancient, permanent methods of recording information aren't slow enough to keep up with tech obsolescence."

- text: "I'm not saying tech moves fast, but my 'cutting-edge' laptop just got a letter from the Smithsonian."
  explanation: "This joke uses hyperbole to suggest that technology becomes museum-worthy almost instantly, playing on how quickly devices go from state-of-the-art to antiquated."

- text: "What's the difference between a tech trend and yogurt? Yogurt has a longer shelf life."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses the unexpected pairing of perishable food with technology trends to highlight how ephemeral tech fads are, suggesting they expire even faster than dairy products."

- text: "Started a new project with the latest tech stack. By the time I finished the README, it was a legacy system."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to show how ridiculously fast technology evolves, suggesting that even the minimal time to document a project is enough for the entire stack to become outdated."

- text: "Why did the developer feel old at 25? He remembered when there were only three JavaScript frameworks."
  explanation: "This plays on the rapid proliferation of frameworks and tools, suggesting that even recent history (when there were 'only' three frameworks) feels ancient in the tech world, making young developers feel obsolete."

- text: "My company adopted microservices, then nanoservices, then picoservices. Now each function is its own startup."
  explanation: "This uses escalating absurdity to satirize how architectural trends keep pushing toward smaller and smaller units, taking the trend to its illogical extreme where individual functions become separate entities."

- text: "How do you know you're at a tech conference? Half the talks are about technologies that won't exist next year, and the other half are about technologies that stopped existing last year."
  explanation: "This observational joke highlights the disconnect between tech conference content and actual technology lifecycles, where discussions are either premature or retrospective, rarely current."

- text: "I'm writing a book called 'Timeless Programming Principles.' The publisher wants it as a blog post instead—books take too long to print."
  explanation: "This ironic joke shows how even attempts to capture permanent knowledge are thwarted by the pace of change, with the medium itself (books) being too slow for the subject matter."

- text: "Why did the blockchain developer become a farmer? He wanted to work with something that actually grows over time instead of just pivoting."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the constant pivoting and rebranding in tech trends (especially in hyped areas like blockchain), contrasting it with the steady, predictable growth of agriculture."

- text: "My fitness tracker is now a vintage collectible. I bought it last Tuesday."
  explanation: "This uses extreme temporal compression to mock how quickly consumer technology becomes obsolete, suggesting that a week is enough time for something to go from new to antique."

- text: "What's a developer's favorite time travel movie? Any of them—because they're all documentaries about trying to understand last year's codebase."
  explanation: "This meta-joke suggests that looking at code from even a year ago feels like traveling to a completely different era, with different technologies and approaches that are now incomprehensible."

- text: "I don't always refactor my code, but when I do, three new frameworks have been released that make my approach obsolete."
  explanation: "This plays on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting how even the act of improving code is futile against the pace of new framework releases."

- text: "Why did the AI researcher refuse to make predictions? Last time he said 'this will never work,' it became a unicorn. When he said 'this is the future,' it was deprecated by Thursday."
  explanation: "This joke captures the unpredictability of tech trends, where expert predictions are consistently wrong in both directions, making forecasting impossible in the rapidly changing landscape."

- text: "My smart home is so outdated that when I say 'Hey Google,' it responds with 'Ask Jeeves.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the reference to Ask Jeeves (an obsolete search engine) to suggest that smart home technology ages so quickly that it regresses through multiple generations of tech history."

- text: "What's the half-life of a tech trend? The time it takes for the think pieces about it to finish loading."
  explanation: "This clever joke suggests that tech trends decay so fast that by the time articles analyzing them fully load on your screen, the trend is already half-dead, combining commentary speed with trend obsolescence."

- text: "I finally understand quantum computing: it's when your tech stack exists in a superposition of being both cutting-edge and deprecated until someone checks the Hacker News front page."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke applies quantum mechanics concepts to technology trends, suggesting that whether something is current or obsolete is uncertain until observed (measured by community opinion), perfectly capturing the subjective and volatile nature of tech trend assessment."
