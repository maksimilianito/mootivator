- text: "My code works perfectly, except when it doesn't."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common developer experience where code appears to work in some scenarios but fails in others, highlighting the unpredictable nature of bugs. The humor comes from the obvious contradiction and the understated way it describes the frustrating reality of software development."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the bug go to therapy? It had unresolved issues."
  explanation: "This uses a simple pun on 'issues' - both a psychological term and the technical term for tracked bugs in software. The personification of the bug adds to the absurdity while reflecting how developers often anthropomorphize their code problems."
  rating: 5

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the famous 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous but surprisingly common practice of testing code in live production environments. The humor comes from admitting a terrible practice with unearned confidence."
  rating: 8

- text: "Software quality assurance is like a seat belt - nobody thinks they need it until after the crash."
  explanation: "This uses analogy to compare QA testing to safety equipment, pointing out the common mistake of undervaluing testing until bugs cause serious problems. The delayed recognition creates the humorous tension."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs, it just develops random features."
  explanation: "This inverts the classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' defense mechanism by suggesting bugs spontaneously become features. The joke satirizes how developers sometimes rationalize coding errors rather than fixing them."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers confuse Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25."
  explanation: "This is a mathematical pun: octal 31 (base 8) equals decimal 25 (base 10). It requires understanding of number systems, making it a classic programmer joke that rewards technical knowledge while appearing to be about holiday confusion."
  rating: 9

- text: "A bug walked into a bar. The bartender said, 'We don't serve your type here.' The bug replied, 'But I'm a feature!'"
  explanation: "This combines the classic bar joke format with the programming trope of bugs being defended as features. The wordplay on 'type' (both social category and data type) adds an additional layer for technical audiences."
  rating: 6

- text: "There are two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "This joke lists three problems while claiming there are only two, thereby demonstrating an off-by-one error in the joke itself. It's recursive humor that performs the very mistake it's describing, making it meta-funny."
  rating: 10

- text: "I spent all day debugging, only to realize the bug was in a different file. At least I made that other file really clean."
  explanation: "This captures the frustrating experience of looking for a bug in the wrong place, with the consolation prize being accidentally improved code. The humor comes from finding a silver lining in wasted effort."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't Node how to Express himself."
  explanation: "This pun combines Node.js and Express (popular JavaScript frameworks) with emotional expression. The capitalization emphasizes the technical terms while the setup suggests genuine emotional problems, creating incongruity."
  rating: 5

- text: "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: "This metaphor perfectly captures the paradox of debugging - you're investigating problems you created yourself. The noir detective imagery adds drama to the mundane act of fixing your own mistakes, creating humor through exaggeration."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code passed all the tests! Unfortunately, I only wrote one test, and it was checking if the computer was on."
  explanation: "This satirizes inadequate testing practices by taking them to an absurd extreme. The confidence in the first sentence is immediately undermined by revealing the test was essentially meaningless, creating comedic deflation."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation."
  explanation: "This cynical observation suggests that the only difference between errors and intended behavior is whether someone wrote it down as intentional. It's a dark truth about software development presented as a simple question-answer joke."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my code to break, and it actually listened. Now I can't get it to stop."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'break' (debugging breakpoint vs. actually breaking). The irony of code finally doing what you asked, but in the worst possible way, reflects the frustrating unpredictability of programming."
  rating: 7

- text: "Error messages are just the program's way of saying 'I have no idea what you want, but I'm pretty sure this isn't it.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes error messages as confused responses rather than helpful diagnostics. It captures the often-cryptic nature of error messages that seem designed to confuse rather than help."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "This is a pun on 'cache' (computer memory) and 'cash' (money). The setup suggests a financial story but delivers a technical punchline, using the homophone for a simple but effective wordplay joke."
  rating: 4

- text: "The best thing about a Boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'bit' (binary digit) as a pun for 'a little bit.' It's mathematically accurate - a Boolean can only be true or false, one bit of information - while also being linguistically playful."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally fixed that bug that's been haunting me for weeks. Turns out I fixed it three days ago but forgot to save the file. The bug was me all along."
  explanation: "This is a twist ending joke where the real bug is human error (not saving), not code. The self-realization and the phrase 'the bug was me all along' mimics a mystery story revelation, adding dramatic irony to a simple mistake."
  rating: 7

- text: "Heisenbug: A bug that disappears when you try to debug it, as if observing it changes its behavior. Physicists call this 'quantum mechanics.' Programmers call this 'Tuesday.'"
  explanation: "This references the Heisenberg uncertainty principle from quantum physics while naming a real phenomenon in programming. The escalation from scientific concept to mundane weekday perfectly captures how bizarre behavior is just routine for developers."

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
  explanation: "This brilliantly illustrates the difference between testing and real-world usage. The QA engineer tests edge cases and invalid inputs, but the first actual user finds an untested scenario that breaks everything. It's a perfect metaphor for how comprehensive testing still misses obvious use cases."
  rating: 10

- text: "I don't have bugs in my code. I have spontaneous features that are yet to be documented as intentional. Some of them even ship before the main features do. I call it 'agile development.'"
  explanation: "This is peak developer rationalization, taking multiple industry concepts (features, documentation, agile methodology) and twisting them to defend buggy code. The escalating justifications and the final ironic invocation of 'agile development' creates layers of humor that satirize both poor coding practices and management buzzwords."
