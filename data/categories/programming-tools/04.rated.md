- text: My IDE autocompletes my code faster than I can think. Now I'm worried it's reading my mind.
  explanation: This joke plays on the incongruity between the impressive speed of modern IDE features and the paranoid interpretation that it might be telepathic rather than just well-designed software.
  rating: 6

- text: Why did the developer break up with their IDE? Too many commitment issues.
  explanation: A pun on Git's "commit" command combined with relationship terminology, creating a double meaning that works both technically and emotionally.
  rating: 7

- text: I switched to Vim. My productivity dropped 90%, but at least I can finally exit it.

- text: My text editor has more plugins than my code has features.
  explanation: Self-deprecating humor about developers spending more time configuring their tools than actually building software, a common procrastination pattern in the industry.
  rating: 7

- text: Why don't IDEs ever get lonely? They're always surrounded by their dependencies.

  explanation: Uses "breakpoints" as both a technical debugging term and a metaphor for emotional trauma, creating layered meaning between technical and psychological concepts.
  rating: 8

- text: I spent three hours configuring my development environment. I wrote zero lines of code. This is what peak performance looks like.
  explanation: Ironic humor mocking the tendency of developers to obsess over tooling setup, claiming obvious procrastination as "peak performance" in a self-aware way.
  rating: 9

- text: Why do developers love dark mode? Because their code looks better when you can't see it clearly.
  explanation: Self-deprecating joke suggesting that code quality is so poor it benefits from reduced visibility, while also playing on the popular dark mode aesthetic preference.
  rating: 8

- text: My IDE's error messages are more passive-aggressive than my code reviews. "Did you mean to do that? Because I wouldn't have."
  explanation: Anthropomorphizes IDE error messages as judgmental and sarcastic, exaggerating the sometimes condescending tone of automated suggestions into full personality.
  rating: 7

- text: I switched from VS Code to Emacs. My fingers now have their own GitHub repository for all the custom keybindings.

- text: Why did the programmer refuse to use an IDE? They wanted to feel the pain of their ancestors who coded in punch cards.
  explanation: Mocks the sometimes elitist attitude of "hardcore" developers who reject modern conveniences, comparing it to unnecessary masochism and romanticizing the past.
  rating: 7

- text: My code editor has AI autocomplete now. Yesterday it suggested I take a vacation. I think it's trying to tell me something.
  explanation: Absurdist humor imagining AI becoming so advanced it recognizes code quality issues and suggests the real solution is for the developer to step away entirely.
  rating: 9

- text: Why don't debuggers ever win at poker? They always reveal their breakpoints.
  explanation: Pun combining the poker term "tell" with debugging breakpoints, creating a scenario where the technical feature becomes a disadvantage in an unrelated context.
  rating: 5

- text: I installed so many IDE extensions that now it takes longer to boot than my operating system. But at least my syntax highlighting has 47 color schemes.
  explanation: Satirizes the tendency to over-customize development environments to the point of absurdity, claiming a trivial cosmetic benefit justifies serious performance problems.
  rating: 8

- text: Why did the developer marry their IDE? It was the only thing that truly understood their code... and didn't judge them for it.
  explanation: Combines romantic relationship humor with the intimate relationship developers have with their tools, suggesting the IDE offers unconditional acceptance that humans cannot.
  rating: 7

- text: My pair programming partner is Vim. We finish each other's commands, but I still don't know what half of them do.
  explanation: Parodies romantic relationship tropes while acknowledging Vim's cryptic command structure, creating humor from the contradiction of intimacy without understanding.

- text: I tried using Emacs as my operating system. Now my text editor occasionally boots into Linux.
  explanation: References the famous joke that "Emacs is a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor," but inverts it absurdly to suggest Emacs has actually consumed the OS.
  rating: 9

- text: Why did the IDE apply for a job at a therapist's office? It had years of experience listening to developers blame it for their own mistakes.

  rating: 8

- text: My IDE's autocomplete is so aggressive, it finished my resignation letter before I realized I was writing one. It auto-committed it to HR's email. I'm now unemployed, but my code coverage is at 100%.
  explanation: Multi-layered absurdist story that escalates from helpful autocomplete to life-ruining automation, ending with darkly ironic prioritization of metrics over employment, perfectly capturing developer culture's obsession with tooling.
