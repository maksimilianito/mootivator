- text: "UX Designer's motto: 'The user is always right... to be confused.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the customer service phrase 'the customer is always right' but twists it to reflect the reality that users often find interfaces confusing, despite designers' best efforts. It's a gentle acknowledgment of the perpetual challenge in UX design."

- text: "Why did the button break up with the form? It felt too much pressure."
  explanation: "This uses personification of UI elements with a double meaning of 'pressure' - both the literal action of pressing a button and the emotional pressure in relationships. It's a simple pun on common UI interactions."
  rating: 4

- text: "Our users wanted a simple interface. So we removed all the features they actually use."
  explanation: "This satirizes the tension between minimalist design trends and functional requirements. It highlights how 'simplicity' can sometimes go too far when designers prioritize aesthetics over utility."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a UX designer's favorite exercise? User journey mapping... it's quite a stretch."
  explanation: "A play on words where 'stretch' refers both to the physical exercise and to the sometimes overly ambitious or unrealistic user journey maps that designers create. It pokes fun at the complexity of these diagrams."
  rating: 5

- text: "The three states of a UI element: working, broken, and 'works on my machine.'"
  explanation: "This adapts the classic programmer's excuse to the UX context, highlighting how interfaces behave differently across devices, browsers, and user scenarios - a constant frustration in design testing."
  rating: 7

- text: "User testing revealed our interface was intuitive. We're investigating what went wrong."
  explanation: "This inverts expectations - normally positive user testing would be celebrated, but the joke suggests that if users find something intuitive, the designers must have made a mistake. It satirizes overthinking in design."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't UX designers trust stairs? They prefer user flows."
  explanation: "A pun on 'user flows' (the paths users take through an interface) and physical flows/stairs. It plays on the jargon of UX design applied to everyday objects."
  rating: 3

- text: "I asked users what they wanted. They said 'make it pop.' I'm now a graphic designer."
  explanation: "This mocks the vague, unhelpful feedback designers often receive. 'Make it pop' is notoriously meaningless feedback that doesn't provide actionable direction, leading to the absurd career change."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our app has a great user experience! Unfortunately, nobody can figure out how to download it."
  explanation: "This highlights the irony of perfecting the in-app experience while neglecting the crucial first step of user acquisition. It's about missing the forest for the trees in UX design."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a UX designer and a magician? A magician makes things disappear on purpose."
  explanation: "This jokes about how elements in interfaces sometimes disappear unintentionally due to responsive design issues, browser compatibility, or bugs - unlike a magician's deliberate illusions."
  rating: 7

- text: "We conducted A/B testing. Version A confused users. Version B confused users differently."
  explanation: "This satirizes how A/B testing doesn't always provide clear winners, and sometimes both options are problematic in their own ways. It's about the ambiguity of user research results."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the UX designer bring a ladder to work? To improve the information architecture."
  explanation: "A visual pun on 'architecture' - using a literal ladder (for building) to work on information architecture (the structural design of information). It plays on the construction metaphor in tech terminology."
  rating: 4

- text: "My design philosophy is simple: if users need a tutorial, I've failed. That's why I now write tutorials full-time."
  explanation: "This captures the paradox where designers aim for intuitive interfaces that need no explanation, but the complexity of modern apps often requires documentation anyway, leading to an ironic career pivot."
  rating: 8

- text: "User feedback: 'I love how minimalist this is!' Translation: 'Where did you hide everything I need?'"
  explanation: "This reveals the gap between what users say and what they mean, highlighting how compliments about minimalism can mask frustration about missing functionality. It's about reading between the lines of user feedback."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a user interface that works perfectly? A prototype that hasn't met real users yet."
  explanation: "This cynically suggests that interfaces only seem perfect in controlled environments, and real-world usage always reveals problems. It's about the humbling experience of actual user testing versus idealized design."
  rating: 9

- text: "I designed a hamburger menu so intuitive, users thought it was a restaurant app."
  explanation: "This plays on the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) used for navigation menus, joking that its intuitiveness backfired by being too literal. It mocks the sometimes questionable 'intuitiveness' of design patterns."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our accessibility audit found issues. Good news: they're consistently inaccessible across all platforms."
  explanation: "Dark humor about accessibility failures, where the only 'positive' is that the problems are uniform. It satirizes how consistency is usually a design goal, but not when it comes to being consistently bad."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the modal dialog go to therapy? It had serious boundary issues."
  explanation: "This personifies modal dialogs (pop-up windows that block interaction) with the psychological concept of boundary issues. It's a clever parallel between intrusive UI elements and intrusive behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "We asked users to rate our interface from 1 to 10. Most chose to close the survey."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about survey design and user engagement. The act of abandoning the survey itself becomes feedback about the user experience, showing how users vote with their actions rather than ratings."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a UX designer's favorite horror movie? The one where users actually read the documentation."
  explanation: "This inverts expectations - typically users NOT reading documentation is the horror story. But the joke suggests that if users need to read documentation, it means the interface has failed to be intuitive, which is the real horror for designers."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent six months perfecting the onboarding experience. Users now skip it in six seconds. I've achieved a 99.9% efficiency improvement."
  explanation: "Brilliant reframing of failure as success through metrics manipulation. Users skipping onboarding is usually bad, but by measuring 'time to skip' as efficiency, it becomes a win. This satirizes how metrics can be twisted to show anything and how designers cope with users ignoring their carefully crafted experiences."
