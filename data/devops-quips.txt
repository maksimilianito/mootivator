If it works in staging, it will definitely fail in production.
My love language is failed deployments.
CI/CD: Continuous Irritation / Continuous Despair.
Nothing says "fun weekend" like an unscheduled outage.
Staging is just production with training wheels that don’t work.
Yes, I broke prod, but only because I care deeply.
We don’t fix problems, we reroute alerts.
High availability, low sanity.
Our uptime is measured in broken promises.
Production is just QA for paying users.
CI/CD pipelines: because one disaster isn’t enough.
You don’t deploy code, you deploy chaos.
Every rollback is a love letter to your past mistakes.
If you’re not on call at 3 a.m., do you even DevOps?
“Works on my machine” is the first draft of every outage.
Our SLA is just a polite way of saying “don’t sue us.”
There are two types of alerts: false alarms and disasters.
You don’t monitor systems, you babysit them.
Serverless just means someone else cries for you.
Containers: because we like putting disasters in little boxes.
Kubernetes: now you can scale your failures.
Load balancing: sharing misery evenly across servers.
Automated pipelines, manually induced panic.
Every deployment is a gamble with your future.
Blue-green deployment? More like blue-scream deployment.
Infrastructure as code, chaos as lifestyle.
DevOps is 10% coding, 90% apologizing to users.
If you don’t hate YAML, you haven’t used it enough.
Monitoring dashboards: art galleries of pain.
Incident reports are just bedtime stories for managers.
There’s no I in DevOps, but there is an O for “Oh no.”
GitOps: where every commit is a prayer.
We don’t do postmortems, we do pre-disasters.
The cloud is just someone else’s dumpster fire.
CI = Constant Interruptions, CD = Constant Disasters.
The logs know everything, except how to be readable.
PagerDuty: ruining sleep schedules since forever.
Production changes are like tattoos—permanent mistakes.
If it scales horizontally, so does my stress.
Nobody remembers the smooth deploys.
Chaos engineering? That’s just Tuesday.
Containers keep things portable—especially your regrets.
Downtime builds character, and unemployment.
Your pipeline is only as strong as its YAML indentation.
Kubernetes: where pods go to die.
Our servers don’t crash, they just rage quit.
The real disaster recovery plan is prayer.
CI/CD is just gambling with better marketing.
All environments are equal, but production is more equal.
The cloud bill is scarier than any incident.
We don’t fix outages, we just reschedule them.
Yes, it’s automated. No, I don’t trust it.
There’s no staging environment like real users.
DevOps is Latin for "blame me later."
Our SLA stands for Sorry, Late Again.
Every green build hides a lurking monster.
Kubernetes promises self-healing, but not for my soul.
Automation just means faster mistakes.
We don’t do downtime, we do “extended maintenance.”
Feature flags: because flipping switches is therapy.
Incidents aren’t solved, they’re just forgotten.
Alert fatigue is my cardio.
Your rollback strategy is my forward plan.
The cloud makes things easier—especially losing money.
DevOps: where “just a quick change” ruins your week.
CI/CD pipelines are rollercoasters without brakes.
My job is explaining to management why it broke.
We scale infrastructure, not expectations.
The root cause is always DNS.
Or YAML. Or both.
GitOps: it’s not a cult, but we do sacrifice weekends.
Staging is just production’s cosplay.
Every dashboard tells a story of tears.
The real zero-downtime deployment is a myth.
Auto-scaling means auto-panic.
We deploy at 5 p.m. because we love danger.
My favorite cloud provider? Whiskey.
Observability is just watching things burn in HD.
Every runbook is outdated the moment it’s written.
Incidents are just performance art.
Cloud-native = cost-native.
Rollback faster than you break things.
Blue-green is just red all over.
Downtime is temporary, blame is forever.
We don’t scale applications, we scale mistakes.
An outage is just user acceptance testing at scale.
Continuous deployment means continuous regret.
Every alert is a cry for help—usually mine.
99.99% uptime, 100% lies.
Chaos engineering: because accidents weren’t enough.
We don’t write infrastructure as code, we write stress as YAML.
Incident bridges are group therapy sessions.
Monitoring doesn’t prevent issues, it narrates them.
DevOps: the art of looking calm while on fire.
Our best feature is Ctrl+C.
Every successful deployment is just luck.
The only thing more fragile than prod is my sanity.
