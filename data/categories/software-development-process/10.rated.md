- text: "Our sprint planning meetings are so efficient, we finish them right before the next sprint starts."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony to highlight how sprint planning meetings often drag on far too long, taking up most of the sprint itself. The humor comes from calling something 'efficient' when it's actually the opposite—a common frustration in agile development."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to write documentation? He said the code was self-explanatory... from 2019."
  explanation: "This plays on the common excuse that 'code is self-documenting' while adding the twist that even the developer can't understand their own old code. It highlights the universal experience of revisiting old code and having no idea what you were thinking."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our definition of 'done' includes: works on my machine, passes one test, and looks good in the demo."
  explanation: "This satirizes how teams sometimes lower their standards for what constitutes 'done' in software development, especially when under pressure. It references the infamous 'works on my machine' excuse while adding layers of minimal quality standards."
  rating: 8

- text: "The waterfall methodology is perfect—if you're developing software for a project that was completed last year."
  explanation: "This joke criticizes the waterfall methodology's inflexibility and slow adaptation to change. The incongruity comes from praising something while simultaneously pointing out it's only useful for projects that are already finished."
  rating: 6

- text: "How many developers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that's a hardware problem."
  explanation: "This plays on the classic 'light bulb' joke format while highlighting the tendency of software developers to deflect issues outside their domain. It also jokes about the software/hardware divide in tech culture."
  rating: 5

- text: "Our code review process is very thorough: we look at the PR title, check if it's green, and approve."
  explanation: "This satirizes superficial code review practices where reviewers don't actually examine the code carefully. The humor comes from listing steps that sound like a process but are actually just checking automated results."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Scrum Master bring a ladder to standup? Because the team kept saying they were 'blocked.'"
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'blocked' (a common standup term for impediments) by taking it literally. It also gently mocks the ceremonial nature of standup meetings and the Scrum Master's role in removing blockers."
  rating: 6

- text: "We practice continuous integration: our code continuously integrates bugs into production."
  explanation: "This subverts the positive connotation of 'continuous integration' by replacing the expected benefit (smooth deployments) with the unintended consequence (bugs). It's a self-deprecating take on CI/CD practices gone wrong."
  rating: 9

- text: "My favorite agile principle? 'Responding to change over following a plan'—especially when the change is reverting to the original plan."
  explanation: "This ironically references one of the core agile values while pointing out how teams often go in circles, changing direction multiple times only to end up back where they started. It highlights the chaos that can come from too much flexibility."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't developers trust the staging environment? Because it's been lying to them since the beginning of time."
  explanation: "This personifies the staging environment as an untrustworthy entity, referencing the common experience where code works in staging but fails in production. The 'since the beginning of time' adds dramatic exaggeration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our technical debt is so high, we're paying interest in the form of weekend deployments."
  explanation: "This extends the financial metaphor of 'technical debt' by adding the concept of interest payments, cleverly represented as weekend work. It captures the real cost of accumulating technical debt over time."
  rating: 9

- text: "A product manager, a designer, and a developer walk into a bar. The developer says, 'We need to refactor the bar first.'"
  explanation: "This uses the classic 'walk into a bar' setup but subverts it with developer behavior—wanting to improve the infrastructure before actually doing anything. It satirizes the tendency to over-engineer or refactor instead of delivering features."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the team switch from Scrum to Kanban? They got tired of pretending two-week sprints were different from two-week deadlines."
  explanation: "This exposes the reality that sprints can feel like arbitrary deadlines rather than sustainable work rhythms. The humor comes from the honest admission that methodology changes are sometimes just about rebranding the same problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our MVP strategy: ship it broken, call it beta, and let users find the bugs for free."
  explanation: "This cynically describes a minimal viable product approach that's taken too far, where 'MVP' becomes an excuse for poor quality. It plays on the tension between moving fast and maintaining standards, with a dark humor twist about crowdsourced QA."
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know a developer wrote the requirements? They're versioned, peer-reviewed, and will be deprecated before implementation."
  explanation: "This joke highlights how developers bring their coding practices to other activities, while also pointing out the ironic situation where requirements become outdated before the code is even written—a common problem in fast-moving projects."
  rating: 7

- text: "We don't have bugs in production, we have 'undocumented features' that are 'working as implemented.'"
  explanation: "This uses multiple layers of euphemistic language to avoid admitting to bugs. It satirizes corporate speak and the tendency to reframe problems as intentional choices, playing on the famous 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' excuse."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the DevOps engineer break up with their partner? Too many merge conflicts and they refused to rebase their relationship."
  explanation: "This applies Git terminology to relationships, using 'merge conflicts' and 'rebase' as metaphors for relationship problems. The humor works on multiple levels for those familiar with version control struggles."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our retrospectives are very productive: we identify the same three problems every sprint and agree to do nothing about them."
  explanation: "This satirizes the futility of retrospectives when teams don't actually implement changes. The incongruity between 'productive' and the actual outcome creates the humor, reflecting a frustrating reality in many teams."
  rating: 9

- text: "A junior developer asks, 'When will this project be done?' The senior developer laughs, then cries, then opens the backlog and whispers, 'Never.'"
  explanation: "This escalates from laughter to existential despair, capturing the reality of never-ending backlogs and scope creep. The dramatic progression and the whispered 'never' create dark humor about project management reality."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do developers love pair programming? Because that way, two people can be confused about the requirements at the same time."
  explanation: "This subverts the expected benefits of pair programming (knowledge sharing, better code quality) by focusing on shared confusion. It highlights that collaboration doesn't solve fundamental problems like unclear requirements."
  rating: 7

- text: "We finally achieved 100% test coverage! The test just checks if the application starts. Once."
  explanation: "This is the ultimate satirical take on gaming metrics. It appears to celebrate a major achievement (100% coverage) but reveals it's completely meaningless. The 'Once' at the end adds a final devastating blow, suggesting even that minimal test might not be reliable. It perfectly captures how focusing on metrics without understanding their purpose leads to absurd outcomes."
