- text: "My hard drive crashed. At least it didn't take my hopes and dreams with it—those were already gone."
  explanation: "This joke uses self-deprecating humor and the relief theory, where the unexpected twist is that the programmer's hopes and dreams were already lost before the hardware failure, subverting the expectation that the crash would be the worst part."

- text: "Why did the RAM stick go to therapy? It had too many issues to address."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'address' as both a psychological term and a technical term for memory locations in RAM, using the double meaning pattern."

- text: "My computer's cooling fan died. Now it's just a really expensive space heater that occasionally shows error messages."
  explanation: "This joke employs incongruity theory by reframing a failed computer as having a new 'feature' as a space heater, highlighting the absurdity of expensive hardware reduced to basic physics."

- text: "The motherboard failed during my presentation. Even my hardware knows when to abandon ship."
  explanation: "Uses personification and the superiority theory through self-deprecation, suggesting even inanimate objects recognize a disaster in progress."

- text: "Why don't hard drives ever win at poker? Because they always crash when the stakes are high."
  explanation: "A setup-punchline joke using misdirection—starting with a gambling scenario but pivoting to the technical meaning of 'crash' and 'stakes' (high-pressure situations)."

- text: "My GPU died right before rendering finished. It saw what I was creating and chose death."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor using personification, suggesting the hardware made a conscious choice to fail rather than complete the user's presumably terrible work."

- text: "What's the difference between a dead power supply and my motivation? The power supply can be replaced."
  explanation: "Dark self-deprecating humor using the comparison pattern, where the unexpected punchline reveals the programmer's motivation is beyond repair."

- text: "My SSD failed after three years. Turns out 'solid state' doesn't mean 'solid commitment to functioning.'"
  explanation: "Wordplay exploiting the double meaning of 'solid,' applying relationship language to hardware reliability, using incongruity between technical and emotional terminology."

- text: "Why did the CPU overheat during the important compile? It wanted to experience what burnout feels like firsthand."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that parallels programmer burnout with CPU thermal failure, using personification to create empathy between human and hardware suffering."

- text: "The BIOS corrupted itself. Even my computer's fundamental identity is having a crisis."
  explanation: "Applies existential psychology to hardware failure, treating BIOS corruption as an identity crisis, using the incongruity of philosophical concepts applied to firmware."

- text: "My backup drive failed the day after my main drive died. They must have been in a suicide pact."
  explanation: "Dark humor using personification and the absurd scenario of conspiring hardware, highlighting the Murphy's Law nature of cascading failures."

- text: "Why do capacitors always fail at the worst time? Because they're charged with making your life difficult."
  explanation: "Triple pun involving electrical charge, being 'charged with' (accused of), and emotional charge, using layered wordplay for technical audiences."

- text: "The Blue Screen of Death appeared. I didn't know Windows could be so direct about our relationship status."
  explanation: "Treats BSOD as relationship communication, using incongruity between technical errors and emotional honesty, with the misdirection of 'relationship status.'"

- text: "My RAID array failed. Turns out 'redundancy' was just a suggestion, not a promise."
  explanation: "Ironic humor highlighting the gap between theoretical reliability and actual failure, playing on the false security of redundant systems."

- text: "Why did the hardware engineer break up with the motherboard? It had commitment issues—kept randomly disconnecting."
  explanation: "Relationship metaphor applied to hardware instability, using the double meaning of 'connection' as both physical and emotional, with the setup-punchline structure."

- text: "My computer started smoking. I told it those online ads about hot singles in the area weren't real."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor treating hardware failure as naive belief in spam, combining physical overheating with metaphorical 'hot' content, using misdirection pattern."

- text: "The disk controller failed. Now my data is like my childhood dreams—theoretically there, but completely inaccessible."
  explanation: "Philosophical self-deprecation comparing technical failure to psychological repression, using the parallel structure to create layered meaning."

- text: "Why don't failed hard drives ever get invited to parties? Because they always bring up old sectors nobody wants to revisit."
  explanation: "Social metaphor with double meaning—'sectors' as disk regions and as topics of conversation, 'bring up' as both recovery and conversation, creating sophisticated wordplay."

- text: "My thermal paste dried out. Apparently, even the glue holding my computer together has given up on this relationship."
  explanation: "Relationship metaphor treating thermal paste as the 'glue' in both literal and emotional senses, with personification suggesting mutual abandonment."

- text: "What do you call a motherboard that fails after warranty expires? Perfectly calibrated planned obsolescence with impeccable timing."
  explanation: "Cynical humor about corporate practices, using the incongruity of praising failure timing, combining conspiracy theory with technical reality."

- text: "My computer caught fire. The good news? I finally achieved that 'blazing fast performance' the ads promised. The bad news? It was literal."
  explanation: "Peak misdirection humor taking marketing language literally, with a perfect setup-punchline structure that subverts expectations by making the metaphor physical, then explicitly acknowledging the twist for maximum comedic effect."
