- text: "Tech support: where 'Have you tried turning it off and on again?' is both our greeting and farewell."
  explanation: This joke plays on the stereotype that tech support's primary solution is to restart the device, making it both the first and last thing they say. The humor comes from the recognition that this simple solution actually works surprisingly often, despite seeming unhelpful.
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the help desk ticket go to therapy? It had unresolved issues."
  explanation: This uses wordplay on 'unresolved issues' - a technical term for open support tickets and a psychological term for personal problems. The anthropomorphization of the ticket creates the incongruity that generates humor.
  rating: 6

- text: "Customer: 'My computer says it has performed an illegal operation.' Tech support: 'Have you contacted a lawyer?'"
  explanation: The humor arises from taking the technical error message literally, as if the computer had committed an actual crime. This misdirection exploits the gap between technical jargon and everyday language.
  rating: 5

- text: "Tech support is just professional Googling with a better salary."
  explanation: This self-deprecating joke reveals the 'secret' that much of tech support involves searching for solutions online, the same thing users could do themselves. The superiority theory applies as we laugh at the revelation of what we suspected all along.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't tech support agents ever get lost? Because they always follow the troubleshooting tree."
  explanation: This plays on the double meaning of 'tree' as both a decision-making flowchart in tech support and a navigational guide. The pun creates a simple but effective incongruity.
  rating: 4

- text: "A user called saying their computer was frozen. I told them to hold it closer to the heater."

- text: "Why did the tech support agent bring a ladder to work? To help with high-level escalations."
  explanation: This pun plays on 'escalation' meaning both to physically climb higher and to transfer a support ticket to senior staff. The visual absurdity of using a literal ladder enhances the humor.
  rating: 5

- text: "Customer: 'It's not working!' Tech support: 'Can you be more specific?' Customer: 'It's REALLY not working!'"

- text: "I asked tech support why they always sound so calm. They said they've seen things I wouldn't believe... like users storing files in the Recycle Bin for safekeeping."
  explanation: This references the famous 'Blade Runner' quote while revealing genuinely horrifying user behaviors. The layered humor works on both the reference level and the recognition of absurd user practices.
  rating: 9

- text: "Tech support's universal truth: The problem always occurs 'just now' but the user hasn't restarted since the Clinton administration."
  explanation: This exaggerates the common situation where users claim issues are recent despite evidence of long-term neglect. The temporal hyperbole creates humor through absurdist recognition.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the help desk agent become a therapist? They were already asking 'How does that make you feel?' about error messages."
  explanation: This joke draws a parallel between emotional counseling and technical troubleshooting, suggesting that dealing with frustrated users requires similar skills to therapy. The unexpected connection creates the humor.
  rating: 6

- text: "Remote support: where you guide someone through fixing their computer while they describe what they see like they're defusing a bomb. 'I see a blue button... no wait, it's teal... or is that cyan?'"
  explanation: This captures the absurd precision required in remote support when users lack technical vocabulary. The bomb-defusing comparison elevates mundane tasks to dramatic levels, creating humor through exaggeration.

- text: "Tech support drinking game: Take a shot every time someone says 'I didn't change anything.' You'll be unconscious in an hour, which is preferable."
  explanation: This combines the frustration of users denying responsibility with dark humor about coping mechanisms. The relief theory applies as it channels legitimate workplace stress into comedy.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do tech support agents make excellent detectives? Because they know everyone is lying about what they clicked."

- text: "Customer opened a ticket saying their keyboard wasn't working. They submitted it using their keyboard. I closed the ticket with 'Unable to reproduce issue.'"
  explanation: This showcases the logical paradox where the complaint contradicts its own method of delivery. The deadpan response adds an extra layer of humor through professional passive-aggression.
  rating: 9

- text: "Tech support is 10% technical knowledge, 20% Google skills, and 70% emotional labor convincing users you didn't just Google it in front of them."
  explanation: This breaks down the actual job composition in a way that reveals uncomfortable truths about the profession. The specific percentages add a pseudo-scientific authority to the absurdity.
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the tech support agent refuse to work on Halloween? Too many users already calling about their computers being 'possessed' and 'haunted by demons.'"
  explanation: This plays on users' tendency to anthropomorphize and dramatize technical issues. The seasonal specificity adds an extra layer while highlighting how users describe normal glitches in supernatural terms.
  rating: 7

- text: "A tech support agent died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Welcome! Did you try turning yourself off and on again?' He came back to life. Now he understands why users hate that question."
  explanation: This meta-joke applies tech support logic to mortality itself, creating multiple layers of absurdity. The circular reasoning and role reversal make this a sophisticated piece of programming humor.
  rating: 8

- text: "Tech support discovered the root cause of 90% of issues: the problem exists between keyboard and chair. They call it PEBKAC. The other 10% is when tech support becomes PEBKAC for each other."
  explanation: This introduces the classic tech support acronym while adding a self-aware twist that even experts make user errors. The self-deprecating addition elevates it beyond simple user-blaming humor.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why is tech support like quantum mechanics? The act of observing the problem changes it. Users can never reproduce the error when you're watching, but it happens constantly when you're not. Schr√∂dinger's bug: simultaneously existing and not existing until tech support checks."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke applies quantum physics principles to the frustrating phenomenon of irreproducible bugs. The multiple layers reference advanced science, common tech support experiences, and philosophical paradoxes, making it intellectually satisfying humor that works on several levels simultaneously.
