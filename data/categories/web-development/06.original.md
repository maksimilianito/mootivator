- text: "CSS: Where you spend 3 hours centering a div and call it a productive day."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the infamous difficulty of centering elements in CSS, a task that seems simple but often requires complex solutions. The humor comes from the incongruity between the simplicity of the goal and the disproportionate time investment, highlighting a universal web developer frustration."

- text: "Why did the HTML element go to therapy? It had too many issues with its parent."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'parent' which in HTML refers to container elements, but also references family relationships. The joke works on the incongruity of applying human psychological problems to code structure, while also nodding to the cascading inheritance challenges in web development."

- text: "JavaScript: The only language where you can add an array to an object and get 'NaN' but somehow that's not the weirdest thing."
  explanation: "This highlights JavaScript's notorious type coercion quirks and unexpected behaviors. The humor comes from the absurdity of the language's loose typing system and the relief theory - developers bond over shared frustration with JavaScript's counterintuitive results."

- text: "A web developer walks into a bar. Then a restaurant. Then a store. He was testing his navigation menu."
  explanation: "This misdirection joke sets up the expectation of a traditional 'walks into a bar' joke but pivots to a technical punchline about testing website navigation. It applies programming logic (testing all links) to a physical scenario, creating incongruity."

- text: "Why do web developers prefer dark mode? Because their future is already bright enough with all those console errors."
  explanation: "This combines the common preference for dark mode with self-deprecating humor about debugging. The unexpected twist is that brightness comes from errors rather than success, using superiority theory to bond over shared struggles."

- text: "My website is like my diet - full of cookies and constantly crashing."
  explanation: "Double meaning wordplay on 'cookies' (HTTP cookies vs. food) and the parallel between personal health struggles and website performance issues. The self-deprecating nature makes it relatable while highlighting common web development challenges."

- text: "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it."
  explanation: "Simple pun on 'console' (console.log() in JavaScript vs. emotional consoling). The brevity and clear wordplay make this accessible while being technically specific to web development debugging practices."

- text: "I told my client the website would be responsive. Now it talks back to me."
  explanation: "Plays on the double meaning of 'responsive' - responsive web design (adapting to screen sizes) versus responding verbally. The misdirection creates humor through the unexpected interpretation of a technical term."

- text: "Why did the web developer leave the restaurant? Because they couldn't find the table layout."
  explanation: "References the old HTML table-based layouts versus modern CSS techniques. Works on multiple levels - literal restaurant tables and HTML table elements, with added nostalgia for those who remember table-based design."

- text: "CSS Grid and Flexbox walk into a bar. The bartender says, 'Finally, you two are working together!'"
  explanation: "Personifies CSS layout systems and references the historical progression from one technology to another, and the modern practice of using both. The humor comes from treating layout systems as characters with a relationship arc."

- text: "My code doesn't work and I don't know why. My code works and I don't know why. - Every web developer's autobiography."
  explanation: "Captures the universal experience of mysterious bugs and equally mysterious fixes. The parallel structure emphasizes the absurdity of both situations, using relief theory to acknowledge the chaotic nature of debugging."

- text: "Why did the web developer go broke? He lost everything in the cache."
  explanation: "Pun on 'cache' (browser cache) and 'cash' (money). The wordplay is enhanced by the technical accuracy - clearing cache is a common troubleshooting step, making the financial loss metaphor particularly apt."

- text: "I'm not saying JavaScript is weird, but it's the only language where '0' is false but '0' is also true, depending on how you ask."
  explanation: "Highlights JavaScript's confusing truthy/falsy evaluation system. The setup-punchline structure builds tension around the word 'weird' then delivers a specific technical absurdity that demonstrates the point perfectly."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks: 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "Classic database humor applied to web development (since web devs often work with databases). The SQL JOIN operation is personified, creating incongruity between database operations and social interaction."

- text: "Web developers are the only people who can look at 404 Not Found and think, 'At least it's consistent.'"
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about low expectations and the relief of predictable errors. The joke acknowledges that web developers become so accustomed to problems that consistency in failure becomes a positive trait."

- text: "Why do front-end developers eat lunch alone? Because they can't stop talking about which framework is better."
  explanation: "Satirizes the notorious 'framework wars' in front-end development (React vs Vue vs Angular, etc.). Uses superiority theory to gently mock the community's tendency toward passionate technical debates."

- text: "I spent 6 hours debugging my CSS. Turns out I had an extra semicolon. In my JavaScript file."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor about debugging wild goose chases. The punchline's unexpected location of the error (wrong file, wrong language) amplifies the frustration and wasted time, creating relief through shared experience."

- text: "What's the difference between HTML and HTML5? About 5."
  explanation: "Extremely simple mathematical pun that works on the surface level while subtly mocking how version numbers don't always reflect the magnitude of changes. The brevity and obviousness create unexpected charm."

- text: "My website's loading time is like a good wine - it gets longer with age and nobody's impressed anymore."
  explanation: "Inverts the 'fine wine' metaphor to describe performance degradation. The double-layered humor works both as commentary on technical debt and as self-deprecating acknowledgment of poor optimization practices."

- text: "Why did the web developer stay calm during the server crash? He had already accepted his fate during npm install."
  explanation: "References the notoriously lengthy and sometimes problematic npm package installation process. The joke suggests that dealing with npm has prepared developers for any disaster, using exaggeration for comedic effect."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. - Every web developer's secret confession."
  explanation: "Parodies the 'Most Interesting Man' meme while exposing a taboo practice (testing in production). The humor comes from the relief of admitting a common but professionally discouraged practice, creating community bonding through shared guilt."
