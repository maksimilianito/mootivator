- text: "My code editor has better memory than I do. It remembers every file I've opened since 2019. I can't remember what I had for breakfast."
  explanation: "Contrasts IDE's session persistence features with human memory limitations, using exaggeration and self-deprecation."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer install 47 VS Code extensions? He was trying to find the one that writes code for him."

- text: "My Emacs configuration is 10,000 lines long. I've achieved enlightenment, but I've forgotten how to exit."
  explanation: "Combines the Emacs vs Vim exit joke tradition with the notorious complexity of Emacs customization, suggesting over-engineering leads to basic incompetence."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't real programmers use IDEs? They do—they just pretend it's a text editor with 'a few plugins' to maintain street cred."
  explanation: "Satirizes the elitism in programmer culture where using powerful tools is seen as less pure, revealing the hypocrisy through misdirection."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my IDE to refactor my code. It suggested refactoring my career choices instead."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor suggesting the IDE gained sentience and life-coaching abilities, using incongruity between expected (code analysis) and delivered (life advice) results."

- text: "I finally achieved the perfect workflow: Vim for editing, Emacs for email, VS Code for debugging, and Notepad for my suicide note when they all crash simultaneously."
  explanation: "Dark humor building through listing increasingly complex tool combinations, ending with absurdist exaggeration of the stress caused by tool management itself."
  rating: 8

- text: "My IDE autocompleted my code so well, it wrote the entire project, filed the patent, and is now suing me for copyright infringement."
  explanation: "Absurdist escalation taking autocomplete features to their logical extreme, creating a scenario where the tool becomes more capable than the user and legally hostile, highlighting anxieties about AI-assisted coding."
