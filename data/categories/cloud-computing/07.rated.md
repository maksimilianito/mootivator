- text: "I moved my files to the cloud, but they're still taking up space on my credit card."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'space' - while cloud storage doesn't take physical space, it costs money, creating an unexpected connection between digital storage and financial burden."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer go cloud computing? Because his local machine was having a meltdown."
  explanation: "A simple pun that uses 'meltdown' to refer both to computer failure and the emotional state of the developer, with cloud computing as the escape solution."
  rating: 4

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer that you pay rent for."
  explanation: "This demystifies cloud computing through an unexpected but accurate analogy to real estate, highlighting the economic reality behind the abstract concept."
  rating: 8

- text: "My boss asked me to explain our cloud infrastructure. I said it's complicated, but he should just trust that it's up there somewhere."
  explanation: "This plays on the vague, intangible nature of 'the cloud' and the irony that even IT professionals sometimes struggle to explain where data actually resides."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't clouds ever get lost? Because they always know their IP address!"
  explanation: "A straightforward pun combining weather clouds with cloud computing, using the technical concept of IP addresses as the unexpected punchline."
  rating: 3

- text: "I asked my cloud provider for better uptime. They said they'd look into it... when they get back online."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the paradox of a cloud service being down while promising better reliability, highlighting the irony of depending on always-available services."
  rating: 7

- text: "Virtualization: because one computer wasn't enough problems."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority/self-deprecating pattern, suggesting that multiplying virtual machines multiplies technical problems exponentially."
  rating: 6

- text: "The cloud is 90% water vapor and 10% vendor lock-in."
  explanation: "A clever play on the composition of actual clouds, replacing the remaining percentage with a common frustration in cloud computing - being trapped with one provider."

- text: "Why did the startup move to the cloud? Because their office couldn't handle any more servers, pizza boxes, or dreams."
  explanation: "This paints a humorous picture of startup culture, combining the practical need for cloud computing with the stereotypical startup environment and ambitions."

- text: "My data is in the cloud, which means it's definitely on Earth, probably in Virginia, and theoretically secure."
  explanation: "This joke progressively demystifies 'the cloud' while decreasing certainty at each step, playing with the abstract nature of cloud computing versus physical reality."
  rating: 9

- text: "I tried to touch the cloud. HR said that's not what 'hands-on experience' means."
  explanation: "A multi-layered joke that plays on the literal interpretation of 'cloud' and 'hands-on,' creating an absurd workplace scenario."

- text: "How many cloud engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? None, they just virtualize the darkness."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic lightbulb joke format by suggesting cloud engineers would solve the problem through abstraction rather than direct action, satirizing over-engineering."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our company went serverless. Now we have no idea who to blame when things break."
  explanation: "This highlights the irony that 'serverless' doesn't mean no servers exist, just that you can't access them, removing a convenient scapegoat for problems."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why was the cloud service always calm? Because it had excellent load balancing... and therapy."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke that applies technical load balancing to emotional well-being, creating an unexpectedly human characterization of cloud infrastructure."
  rating: 6

- text: "I put all my eggs in one basket, then put that basket in the cloud. Now I have a distributed single point of failure."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated technical humor about how moving to the cloud doesn't automatically solve architectural problems - you can still have poor design at a higher level."
  rating: 9

- text: "A cloud architect walks into a bar. Or did he? The bar is virtualized, the architect is working remotely, and the drinks are served via API."
  explanation: "This deconstructs the classic 'walks into a bar' joke format by applying cloud computing concepts to every element, creating absurdist humor about our increasingly virtual world."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the sysadmin refuse to go cloud computing? He said he'd rather keep his problems local where he could yell at them directly."
  explanation: "This personifies technical problems and plays on the old-school sysadmin preference for physical control, creating humor through the absurd image of someone yelling at servers."
  rating: 7

- text: "My cloud bill arrived. Apparently 'unlimited scalability' means my costs can scale infinitely too. Who knew?"
  explanation: "This uses feigned innocence to highlight a painful truth about cloud computing - that scalability works both ways, often to the customer's financial detriment."

- text: "I told my therapist I have commitment issues. She said I should try cloud computing - you can spin up and destroy relationships in seconds."
  explanation: "This applies the ephemeral nature of cloud instances to human relationships, creating dark humor through the unexpected connection between emotional issues and infrastructure management."

- text: "A developer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Welcome to the cloud!' The developer replied, 'Great! What's the SLA on eternal life, and do you have a rollback plan?'"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated meta-humor that applies cloud computing concepts to the afterlife, with the developer's inability to stop thinking technically even in heaven creating the comedy through character consistency and absurdity."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why is the cloud like a teenager? It promises to be responsible, costs way more than you expected, and you're never quite sure what it's doing with your stuff."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor works on multiple levels, comparing cloud services to parenting challenges, with each parallel reinforcing the others to create cumulative humor about trust, cost, and transparency issues."
