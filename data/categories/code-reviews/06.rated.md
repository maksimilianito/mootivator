- text: "Code reviews: where everyone's an expert on code they didn't write."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that during code reviews, reviewers often feel confident critiquing code despite not having wrestled with the original problem themselves. It's a simple observational statement that captures the superiority theory of humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do code reviews take so long? Because 'looks good to me' requires 45 minutes of staring."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity between the simple phrase 'looks good to me' and the excessive time spent. It highlights the reality that reviewers often need significant time to feel confident enough to approve, even when their feedback is minimal."
  rating: 8

- text: "I approve all code reviews immediately. I'm an optimist AND lazy."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that combines two personality traits to explain poor code review practices. The double justification makes the admission more humorous than threatening."
  rating: 6

- text: "Code review status: 'Requested changes' means 'I found a comma I didn't like.'"
  explanation: "Exaggerates the pickiness of some reviewers who focus on trivial issues. This misdirection pattern suggests major problems but reveals minor nitpicking, creating humor through the gap between expectation and reality."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code review comments are either 'nice work!' or a 3000-word essay on architecture. No in-between."
  explanation: "Highlights the absurd extremes some reviewers exhibit, using hyperbole to emphasize the lack of middle ground. The contrast between minimal and excessive feedback creates the comedic effect."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a code review and a therapy session? In therapy, someone actually listens to your reasoning."
  explanation: "Uses comparison humor to suggest that code reviewers dismiss explanations. The setup creates an expectation of similarity, while the punchline reveals a frustrating difference familiar to developers."
  rating: 8

- text: "I left one code review comment and now I'm in a 47-message philosophical debate about variable naming."
  explanation: "Captures the absurd escalation that can occur from minor feedback. The specific number '47' adds comedic precision while highlighting how simple comments spiral into lengthy discussions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code reviews would be faster if we admitted we're just checking if it runs, not if it's elegant."
  explanation: "This joke uses the relief theory, acknowledging the gap between the ideal (elegant code) and reality (code that works). It's a truth many developers recognize but rarely admit openly."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer cry during code review? Someone suggested he rename his variables. He'd named them after his children."
  explanation: "A story-format joke that uses absurdist humor by taking the personal attachment developers feel toward their code to an extreme level. The emotional investment becomes literally familial."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code review feedback: 'This could be more readable.' Translation: 'I don't understand it, but I won't admit that.'"
  explanation: "Exposes the hidden subtext of vague review comments through double meaning. The humor comes from revealing what reviewers actually mean versus what they say, using the superiority theory."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code review drinking game: take a shot every time someone says 'we should refactor this.' You'll be sober because no one ever actually does it."
  explanation: "Sets up expectation of getting drunk, then subverts it with the reality that refactoring suggestions rarely get implemented. The misdirection creates humor while commenting on common team dynamics."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always write perfect code, but when I do, my code reviewer finds the one edge case I missed in line 847."
  explanation: "Plays on the 'most interesting man' meme format while capturing the frustration of having nearly perfect code undermined by one obscure issue. The specific line number adds authenticity."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do code reviewers and literary critics have in common? They both love pointing out what the author 'really meant.'"
  explanation: "Creates a parallel between two seemingly different fields, suggesting reviewers over-interpret intent. The humor comes from recognizing this pretentious behavior in a technical context."
  rating: 7

- text: "Code review stages: 1) This looks great! 2) Wait, what does this do? 3) Why does this exist? 4) Who hurt you?"
  explanation: "A progression joke that escalates from positive to existential concern. The final question implies the code is so problematic it must stem from psychological trauma, using absurdist humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "My pull request has been open for 3 weeks. I've gotten married, had a kid, and retired since requesting review."
  explanation: "Hyperbolic exaggeration of the time it takes to get reviews. The absurd life events emphasize the frustration of waiting for feedback, using temporal impossibility for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers fear code reviews more than production bugs? Because bugs don't judge your choice of whitespace."
  explanation: "Compares two sources of anxiety, revealing that social judgment is more stressful than technical failure. The specific mention of 'whitespace' emphasizes how trivial some review comments can be."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code review comment: 'Have you considered using a design pattern here?' Translation: 'I just learned about design patterns and need everyone to know.'"
  explanation: "Exposes the motivations behind certain review comments, suggesting they're more about the reviewer's ego than code improvement. The meta-humor reveals the social dynamics of technical discussions."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote self-documenting code. My reviewer still asked for comments. I added 'This is self-documenting code' as a comment. Now we're not speaking."
  explanation: "A story-format joke that escalates passive-aggressive behavior. The literal interpretation of the request creates absurdity, while capturing real tensions in code review relationships."
  rating: 10

- text: "What's a code reviewer's favorite movie? 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' because that's what they think their code was like before they review yours."
  explanation: "Clever cultural reference combined with technical context. Suggests reviewers have selective memory about their own code quality, using the movie title's meaning to emphasize hypocrisy."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code reviewer approved my PR with 'LGTM' then immediately filed 14 tickets for technical debt. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works."
  explanation: "Captures the contradiction of approval followed by criticism. The repeated phrase emphasizes frustration while the specific number '14' makes the absurdity concrete. This is meta-humor about the review process itself."
  rating: 8

- text: "Senior developer's code review: 'This is fine.' Junior developer's identical code review: 'Let me write you a 12-page thesis on why every line is wrong, starting with your career choices.'"
  explanation: "Exposes the double standard in code reviews based on seniority. The escalation from technical criticism to personal life choices creates absurdist humor while highlighting real workplace dynamics. The contrast between 'this is fine' and '12-page thesis' emphasizes the unfairness through exaggeration."
