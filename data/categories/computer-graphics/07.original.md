- text: "My shader compiled on the first try. I'm scared."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common experience that graphics shaders, with their complex mathematical operations and GPU-specific syntax, rarely work correctly on the first attempt. The fear comes from the incongruity of success, suggesting something must be wrong if there's no debugging needed."

- text: "Why did the 3D modeler break up with the texture artist? Too many commitment issues with UV mapping."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'commitment' - both as a relationship term and the tedious process of UV mapping (unwrapping 3D models to apply 2D textures), which requires careful planning and is often frustrating."

- text: "Rendering: the art of turning electricity into heat while occasionally producing images."
  explanation: "This aphorism highlights the reality that GPUs consume massive amounts of power and generate significant heat during rendering, with image production almost seeming like a side effect."

- text: "I don't always test my shaders, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A play on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, this jokes about the dangerous practice of not testing graphics code before deployment, which can crash GPUs or produce bizarre visual glitches."

- text: "What's a graphics programmer's favorite type of music? Heavy metal - specifically, the Metal API."
  explanation: "This joke uses double meaning: 'heavy metal' as a music genre and Apple's Metal graphics API, which graphics programmers actually use for GPU programming."

- text: "My raytracer is so slow, it's historically accurate - light actually takes time to arrive."
  explanation: "This jokes about the notorious slowness of raytracing algorithms by reframing the bug as a feature, suggesting it's simulating the actual finite speed of light."

- text: "Why do graphics programmers prefer dark mode? Because they spend all day dealing with light."
  explanation: "This plays on the irony that graphics programmers work extensively with lighting calculations, shaders, and illumination models, so they want darkness in their actual workspace."

- text: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil, but so is rendering at 2 FPS."
  explanation: "This riffs on Donald Knuth's famous programming quote while acknowledging the graphics programmer's dilemma - you can't ignore performance when your frame rate is unplayable."

- text: "I told my GPU to take a break. It sent me a thermal throttling warning."
  explanation: "This personifies the GPU as an overworked employee, when in reality thermal throttling is an automatic hardware protection mechanism that kicks in when GPUs overheat from intensive rendering."

- text: "What do you call a fragment shader that always returns the same color? Consistently disappointing."
  explanation: "This plays on technical and emotional meanings - a shader that outputs constant color is technically useless for most graphics work, but 'consistently disappointing' also suggests repeated letdowns."

- text: "My normal maps are inverted. Everything looks wrong, but technically correct."
  explanation: "Normal maps can be inverted (different coordinate systems), making 3D surfaces look like they have inverted geometry. The humor comes from something being mathematically valid but visually terrible."

- text: "Why did the graphics programmer go to therapy? Too many unresolved dependencies in the render pipeline."
  explanation: "This uses 'unresolved dependencies' as both a technical term (when rendering stages aren't properly synchronized) and psychological term (emotional issues), with 'pipeline' reinforcing both meanings."

- text: "I don't have a drinking problem. I have a Z-fighting problem, and drinking helps me not see it."
  explanation: "Z-fighting is a visual glitch where overlapping surfaces flicker. This jokes about using alcohol to literally blur vision enough to not notice the rendering artifacts."

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior graphics programmer? The senior knows which artifacts are acceptable."
  explanation: "This highlights the wisdom that comes with experience - understanding that perfect rendering is impossible within performance constraints, so you learn which visual compromises are acceptable."

- text: "My mesh has more triangles than my love life has prospects. At least the mesh renders."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke compares high polygon counts (millions of triangles in modern 3D models) to romantic prospects, with the punchline that at least the mesh successfully produces output."

- text: "Why don't graphics programmers trust stairs? They prefer rasterization over ray marching."
  explanation: "This uses technical wordplay - 'stairs' suggests 'steps' which relates to ray marching (stepping through space), while rasterization is the competing rendering technique. The absurdity comes from applying technical preferences to physical architecture."

- text: "I spent six hours optimizing my shader. Gained 0.3 FPS. Told my boss it was 30% faster. Technically, 0.3 is 30% of 1."
  explanation: "This jokes about the desperation of performance optimization and creative interpretation of statistics, where a tiny absolute gain is reframed as an impressive percentage by choosing the right baseline."

- text: "What do you call a perfectly optimized graphics engine? A lie we tell ourselves before the art team adds more particles."
  explanation: "This captures the eternal struggle between programmers optimizing performance and artists adding visual features that consume that performance, suggesting optimization is a Sisyphean task."

- text: "My vertex shader and fragment shader had an argument. Now they're not on speaking terms. My pipeline's broken."
  explanation: "This personifies shader stages as having relationship problems, while 'pipeline's broken' works both as a metaphor for broken communication and the literal technical meaning of a non-functional graphics pipeline."

- text: "Why did the graphics programmer quit gaming? After debugging rendering engines all day, they could only see the artifacts."
  explanation: "This jokes about professional deformation - once you understand how graphics work, you can't unsee the technical shortcuts and visual glitches that normal players ignore, ruining the immersive experience."

- text: "I finally fixed the lighting bug. Turns out I was debugging in the dark the whole time - I forgot to add lights to the scene."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke about the most embarrassing debugging mistake in graphics programming - spending hours debugging complex lighting calculations when the actual problem is simply forgetting to place light sources in the 3D scene, making everything black."
