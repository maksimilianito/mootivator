- text: "A junior developer force-pushed to main. The senior developer force-pushed him to the job board."
  explanation: "This uses parallel structure with 'force-pushed' (a dangerous Git command) applied both to code and to the developer's employment status, suggesting immediate termination for this cardinal sin."
  rating: 10

- text: "I don't have commitment issues. I have 47,000 commits. Most of them say 'fix', 'update', or 'asdfasdf'."
  explanation: "This subverts the commitment pun by claiming many commits, but reveals they're meaningless, highlighting the common problem of poor commit message discipline."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a Git user and a hoarder? The Git user calls it 'version history'."
  explanation: "This compares keeping every version of code to hoarding behavior, suggesting that never deleting old code is just organized hoarding with a technical name."

- text: "My relationship status is like my Git workflow: complicated, full of conflicts, and I'm not sure when the last successful merge happened."

- text: "What's a version control user's favorite exercise? Cherry-picking. It's the only picking they're good at."
  explanation: "This plays on Git's cherry-pick command and the metaphor of being selective, suggesting developers are only good at selective choosing in code, not in life decisions."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked my Git repository for relationship advice. It said: 'You have diverged. Consider rebasing or merging.' I'm still confused."
