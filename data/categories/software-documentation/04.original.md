- text: "Documentation is like a README file: everyone knows it should exist, but nobody reads it until something breaks."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common reality that documentation is often ignored until users encounter problems, creating a parallel with README files that are typically skipped during installation."

- text: "Why did the developer write documentation? His manager asked him to document his excuses."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection - we expect the developer to document code, but the punchline reveals he's documenting his reasons for not writing documentation, creating a humorous paradox."

- text: "The best documentation is the code itself, said every developer who never wrote documentation."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common rationalization developers use to avoid writing documentation, exposing the self-serving nature of the 'self-documenting code' argument."

- text: "How many developers does it take to update documentation? Nobody knows, it's never been done."
  explanation: "This uses the classic 'how many does it take' format to emphasize the notorious problem of outdated documentation in software projects."

- text: "I asked my coworker where the API documentation was. He said, 'Check the source code.' I asked where the source code was. He said, 'Check the documentation.'"
  explanation: "This creates a circular logic loop that mirrors the frustrating experience of trying to find information in poorly organized projects, using the absurdity of infinite recursion."

- text: "Documentation status: TODO. Last updated: 2019. Current year: 2024."
  explanation: "This joke uses a simple factual presentation to highlight the common problem of documentation that's perpetually marked as incomplete and never updated."

- text: "Why don't developers like writing documentation? Because comments are for weak code, and documentation is for weak comments."
  explanation: "This plays on developer ego and the superiority theory, creating a hierarchy of excuses that reveals the absurdity of avoiding documentation altogether."

- text: "My documentation has more deprecation warnings than actual content."
  explanation: "This one-liner uses exaggeration to highlight how documentation often becomes a graveyard of outdated information rather than useful guidance."

- text: "What's the difference between documentation and fantasy fiction? Fantasy fiction has a consistent plot."
  explanation: "This comparison joke suggests documentation is so fragmented and inconsistent that even fantasy novels are more coherent, using unexpected juxtaposition for humor."

- text: "I spent three hours writing documentation today. Tomorrow I'll spend six hours explaining why nobody read it."
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure to reveal the futility of documentation efforts, with the time spent explaining exceeding the writing time itself."

- text: "Our documentation is so good, it's available in three formats: outdated, incomplete, and wrong."
  explanation: "This subverts the expectation of quality documentation formats (like PDF, HTML, Markdown) with three states that describe bad documentation, using the rule of three for comedic effect."

- text: "Why did the API documentation go to therapy? It had too many unresolved references."
  explanation: "This applies a technical term (unresolved references) to a psychological context, creating humor through the double meaning and anthropomorphization of documentation."

- text: "A junior developer asked, 'Where's the documentation?' A senior developer replied, 'You're looking at him.' The junior asked, 'Can I search you?' The senior said, 'Only if you know the right questions.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke plays on the reality that in many organizations, documentation exists only in senior developers' heads, creating a humorous parallel to searchable documentation systems."

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation for my project. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "This short, punchy joke uses the dream sequence format to suggest that complete documentation is so rare it's literally unbelievable, relying on incongruity for humor."

- text: "Our company's documentation philosophy: If it's not documented, it doesn't exist. Corollary: Everything exists and nothing is documented."
  explanation: "This creates a logical paradox that exposes the gap between documentation policies and actual practice, using philosophical framing for comedic effect."

- text: "What do you call documentation that's always up to date? A myth. What do you call a developer who maintains it? Unemployed, because they don't exist either."
  explanation: "This double-punchline joke escalates the absurdity by suggesting that not only is updated documentation mythical, but so are the people who would maintain it."

- text: "I found a bug in production. The documentation said it was impossible. I updated the documentation to say the bug was a feature. Problem solved."
  explanation: "This joke combines multiple programming humor tropes (bugs vs features, documentation inaccuracy) to create a cynical but relatable scenario about managing expectations through documentation."

- text: "Why did the documentation cross the road? It didn't. It's still on the TODO list from 2018."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic 'why did the chicken cross the road' format by denying the premise entirely, emphasizing documentation procrastination through a well-known joke structure."

- text: "A developer died and went to heaven. Saint Peter said, 'You wrote beautiful code.' The developer asked, 'How do you know?' Saint Peter replied, 'We read your documentation.' The developer said, 'Now I know I'm in heaven, because that's the only place anyone would read it.'"
  explanation: "This extended joke uses the afterlife scenario to emphasize how rare it is for documentation to be read, with the punchline suggesting it's literally a miraculous event."

- text: "My code is self-documenting. It documents that I have no idea what I'm doing."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating one-liner subverts the 'self-documenting code' excuse by suggesting the only thing the code documents is the developer's incompetence, using ironic honesty for humor."

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write my documentation. It wrote: 'This function does what it does. Parameters: yes. Returns: maybe. Side effects: probably. Last updated: whenever you're reading this.' I shipped it. Best documentation we've ever had."
  explanation: "This meta-joke about AI-generated documentation uses absurdist humor and deliberately vague language to satirize both the low standards for documentation and the current AI hype, with the punchline suggesting that even terrible documentation is better than what typically exists."
