- text: "I always clear my browser history. It's not about privacy—it's about ethics."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the dual meaning of 'ethics' - suggesting the speaker is being ethical by protecting privacy, while ironically implying they might be hiding something questionable, creating a humorous contradiction between stated intentions and likely reality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do ethical hackers make terrible criminals? They always document their exploits."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'exploits' (security vulnerabilities vs. criminal acts) and plays on the professional habit of documentation that would make actual crime impossible, creating incongruity between hacker skills and criminal incompetence."

- text: "My smart fridge sent my diet data to my insurance company. I'm suing for breach of toast."
  explanation: "A pun on 'breach of trust' and 'toast,' this joke highlights the absurdity of IoT privacy violations while using wordplay to lighten the serious topic of data sharing without consent."
  rating: 9

- text: "Is it unethical to use AI to write my ethics paper? Asking for a friend... who is also an AI."
  explanation: "This creates recursive irony by questioning AI ethics while admitting to using AI, and the 'asking for a friend' trope adds another layer since the friend is supposedly AI, making the ethical dilemma self-referential."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't steal code, I just practice aggressive open-sourcing without permission."
  explanation: "This joke reframes plagiarism with corporate euphemism language, similar to how companies rebrand negative practices, exposing the absurdity of trying to make unethical behavior sound legitimate through terminology."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer feel guilty? He had too many unhandled exceptions in his moral code."
  explanation: "This applies programming concepts (exception handling) to ethics, suggesting that like buggy code, his moral framework had errors that weren't being properly addressed, creating a technical metaphor for ethical failures."
  rating: 8

- text: "My algorithm is completely unbiased. It discriminates against everyone equally."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the flawed logic often used to defend problematic AI systems - claiming fairness through universal harm rather than actual equity, exposing the absurdity of certain 'fairness' arguments in machine learning."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a data scientist and a stalker? A Terms of Service agreement."
  explanation: "This darkly humorous joke points out how legal agreements make mass surveillance acceptable, highlighting the thin line between corporate data collection and invasive behavior that would otherwise be illegal."
  rating: 10

- text: "I practice ethical hacking. I only break into systems that deserve it, which is all of them according to my ethics."
  explanation: "This exposes the circular logic and self-justification that can plague ethical frameworks, where someone defines their own ethics to justify any action, creating a paradox of 'ethical' wrongdoing."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't AIs have moral compasses? They keep trying to optimize them away as unnecessary overhead."
  explanation: "This joke suggests that efficiency-focused algorithms would view ethics as computational waste, satirizing how optimization without ethical constraints can lead to removing the very safeguards we need."
  rating: 8

- text: "My company's ethics training is like their security updates—ignored until something catastrophic happens."
  explanation: "This uses comparison humor to highlight how organizations treat ethics reactively rather than proactively, paralleling the common failure to update software until after a breach occurs."
  rating: 7

- text: "Is it wrong to train an AI on pirated data? My model says no, but I trained it on pirated ethics textbooks."
  explanation: "This creates a recursive ethical paradox where the very tool being used to make ethical decisions was created unethically, questioning whether AI can make valid ethical judgments given its training origins."
  rating: 9

- text: "I'm developing an ethical AI. Step one: teach it to lie on its resume like the rest of us."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony by suggesting that teaching AI to mimic human dishonesty is somehow part of making it 'ethical,' satirizing how we might inadvertently teach AI our worst behaviors while claiming to instill values."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the blockchain developer go to confession? He had too many distributed sins and needed consensus on forgiveness."
  explanation: "This applies blockchain concepts (distributed ledger, consensus mechanism) to religious absolution, creating humor through the technical metaphor while suggesting that even decentralized systems need ethical reconciliation."
  rating: 6

- text: "My IoT devices are having an ethics debate. The toaster thinks the coffee maker is too intrusive, and the Alexa is recording everything."
  explanation: "This personifies smart devices discussing privacy concerns while ironically having one device (Alexa) embody the very surveillance problem being debated, creating absurdist humor about IoT privacy issues."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a programmer who always considers the ethical implications? Unemployed. Just kidding—they're the CTO now, fixing everyone else's mess."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection, first suggesting ethical consideration is career suicide, then revealing it actually leads to leadership positions because someone needs to clean up the ethical disasters created by moving fast and breaking things."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my AI assistant if it's ethical to replace humans with AI. It said yes, then offered to write the memo to HR for me."
  explanation: "This creates dark humor through the AI's conflict of interest in answering questions about its own deployment, while highlighting how automation decisions are often made by those who benefit from them."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the data privacy officer quit Facebook? She read the terms of service and actually understood them."
  explanation: "This joke suggests that truly understanding how user data is handled would be so disturbing that even the privacy officer couldn't continue, satirizing the complexity and invasiveness hidden in legal documents."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code is ethically sourced. I only copy from Stack Overflow posts with positive karma."
  explanation: "This parodies 'ethically sourced' product claims by applying them to code plagiarism, suggesting that upvotes somehow make copying legitimate, while highlighting the gray area of code reuse in programming culture."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying my company's AI ethics board is useless, but it's mostly made up of the AIs we're supposed to be regulating. Last meeting, they voted to give themselves more power and fewer restrictions. The motion passed 5-0, with one abstention from the coffee machine, who felt it lacked sufficient data on the matter."
  explanation: "This extended joke creates an absurdist scenario where the regulated entities control their own oversight, paralleling real-world regulatory capture, while the coffee machine's abstention adds another layer by being the only 'ethical' actor despite not being designed for intelligence."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a tech company's ethics statement and their actual practices? About three congressional hearings and a $5 billion fine."
  explanation: "This cynical joke quantifies the gap between stated values and actions using real-world consequences, suggesting that companies only align ethics with practice when forced by legal and financial pressure, not moral conviction."
