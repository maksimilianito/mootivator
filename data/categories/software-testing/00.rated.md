- text: "QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd."
  explanation: "This joke uses the misdirection pattern and highlights the thorough, sometimes absurd nature of QA testing. It starts with normal test cases (valid input), then progresses through edge cases (zero, maximum values), invalid inputs (lizard), negative numbers, and finally random strings - exactly how a QA engineer would systematically test input validation."

- text: "Why did the unit test go to therapy? It had too many dependencies."
  explanation: "A simple setup-punchline joke using double meaning. In programming, 'dependencies' refers to external code modules, but in the punchline it takes on the psychological meaning of unhealthy reliance on others, creating incongruity between technical and human contexts."
  rating: 7

- text: "Software testing: Because 'it works on my machine' isn't a deployment strategy."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory, poking fun at the common developer excuse. It highlights the gap between local development environments and production systems, a classic source of bugs that testing should catch."
  rating: 8

- text: "A QA tester walks into a bar. Then crawls into a bar. Runs into a bar. Dances into a bar. Flies into a bar. The bar opens and a customer walks in backwards, and the whole place burns down."
  explanation: "This extended joke builds on the first bar joke pattern, showing how QA tests expected behaviors thoroughly, but real users always find the one scenario nobody thought to test. The escalating absurdity mirrors real-world production incidents."
  rating: 9

- text: "99 bugs in the code, 99 bugs in the code. Take one down, patch it around, 127 bugs in the code."
  explanation: "A parody of '99 Bottles of Beer' that illustrates the frustrating reality of bug fixing - solving one problem often creates more. The number increasing rather than decreasing subverts expectations and uses mathematical incongruity for humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't testers ever get lost? They always follow the test case."
  explanation: "Simple wordplay using double meaning - 'test case' as both a testing document and metaphorically as a 'case' or path to follow. Uses the setup-punchline structure with a gentle poke at testers' methodical nature."
  rating: 5

- text: "Testing in production is like performing surgery on yourself. Sure, you'll learn a lot, but probably not the lesson you wanted."
  explanation: "This uses analogy and the relief theory to address a common anti-pattern. The absurd comparison highlights the danger while acknowledging that many teams do it anyway, creating humor through shared guilty recognition."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It just develops random unexpected features."
  explanation: "Classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' humor using misdirection. The phrase 'random unexpected features' is an oxymoron that highlights how developers sometimes rationalize problems rather than fix them."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation."
  explanation: "Cynical one-liner using the superiority theory. It suggests that anything can be justified as intentional if you write it down, poking fun at how specifications are sometimes created retroactively to match implementation."
  rating: 8

- text: "QA Engineer's favorite game? Hide and Seek - but they're always 'it' and the bugs are always hiding."
  explanation: "Uses metaphor and the developer's life category to describe the daily experience of testing. The role reversal (QA always seeking) creates a relatable image of the testing process as an ongoing hunt."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the automated test fail? It couldn't handle the manual labor."
  explanation: "Wordplay on 'manual' (as in manual testing vs. physical labor) creates a pun. The incongruity between automation and manual work highlights the limitations of automated testing in a lighthearted way."
  rating: 6

- text: "A tester's job is to break things professionally. Everyone else just does it accidentally."
  explanation: "Uses the superiority theory to elevate testers while simultaneously acknowledging that bugs happen everywhere. The contrast between 'professionally' and 'accidentally' creates humor through role definition."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do testers make terrible comedians? They always find the edge cases where jokes don't work."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that applies testing methodology to humor itself. The joke is self-referential, suggesting that over-analysis (a tester trait) can kill comedy, which is itself a comedic observation."
  rating: 8

- text: "First rule of testing: If it can break, it will. Second rule: It can always break. Third rule: It will break in ways you never imagined."
  explanation: "Parodies Fight Club's famous rules while expressing Murphy's Law for software. The escalating certainty and expanding scope creates humor through exaggerated pessimism that testers recognize as truth."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many testers does it take to change a light bulb? None. They just document that it's dark and assign it to development."
  explanation: "Classic 'light bulb' joke format applied to software roles. Highlights the boundary between finding bugs (testing) and fixing them (development), using role definition humor and the absurdity technique."
  rating: 7

- text: "Regression testing: Proof that fixing one thing can break everything else, including things that were never related in the first place."
  explanation: "Defines a concept through its worst-case scenario, using exaggeration and the relief theory. The phrase 'never related in the first place' emphasizes the mysterious nature of software interconnections."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the test suite so confident? It had great coverage. Why did it still miss bugs? Because confidence isn't correctness."
  explanation: "Two-part joke that sets up and subverts expectations. Highlights the false security of code coverage metrics - a sophisticated technical concept presented through a simple question-answer format with philosophical undertones."
  rating: 7

- text: "A perfect test suite would test everything. A practical test suite tests what matters. A real test suite tests what you had time for before the deadline."
  explanation: "Three-part escalating joke showing the gap between ideal, pragmatic, and actual practice. Uses the rule of three and descending expectations to create humor through uncomfortable recognition of reality."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the tester refuse to go skydiving? Too many edge cases and no rollback strategy."
  explanation: "Applies testing terminology to real-life risk assessment. The technical terms 'edge cases' (unusual scenarios) and 'rollback strategy' (undo mechanism) create humor by framing a life-or-death situation in software terms."
  rating: 7

- text: "Testing is like archaeology: You dig through layers of code, discover ancient bugs, and wonder what civilization could have possibly created this mess."
  explanation: "Extended metaphor comparing testing to archaeology. The humor builds through the parallel (layers/digging/discovery) and culminates in the shared experience of encountering inexplicable legacy code, mixing wonder and horror."
  rating: 8

- text: "The tester's prayer: Grant me the serenity to accept the bugs I cannot reproduce, the courage to file the ones I can, and the wisdom to know the difference before the developer asks 'works for me?'"
  explanation: "Parodies the Serenity Prayer while capturing the tester-developer dynamic. The final phrase 'works for me?' is the dreaded response every tester knows, making this a sophisticated multi-layered joke that combines spiritual parody with workplace reality and the eternal struggle of bug reproducibility."
