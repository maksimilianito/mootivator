- text: "My code works on the latest framework version. I'm giving it two weeks."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the rapid pace of technology change where frameworks and tools quickly become outdated. The humor comes from the programmer's resigned acceptance that their 'latest' work will soon be obsolete, highlighting the futility of staying current in tech."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to learn the new JavaScript framework? It would be deprecated by the time he finished the tutorial."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to comment on the notorious pace of JavaScript framework evolution. The incongruity lies in the absurd but relatable idea that frameworks change faster than one can learn them."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally mastered React. My boss just asked me to migrate everything to the framework that will replace it next month."
  explanation: "This joke captures the frustration of continuous learning in tech. The humor comes from the timing incongruity—achieving mastery right before it becomes irrelevant—a common developer experience."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our company's technology stack is so cutting-edge, it's already bleeding."
  explanation: "This plays on the dual meaning of 'cutting-edge' and 'bleeding edge,' using a metaphor that suggests being too early to adopt technology can be painful, like a cut that bleeds."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't programmers like to predict the future? Because by the time they finish their prediction algorithm, the future has already changed three times."
  explanation: "This joke uses recursive humor and exaggeration to highlight how rapidly technology evolves, making even predictions about technology outdated before completion."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote my resume in the hottest new programming language. HR couldn't read it because that language is now obsolete."
  explanation: "This employs situational irony where the attempt to appear current backfires due to the very pace of change the candidate was trying to demonstrate knowledge of."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the half-life of a tech trend? The time it takes to write a Medium article about it."
  explanation: "This joke uses scientific terminology (half-life) applied to tech trends, suggesting that by the time someone documents a trend, it's already halfway to obsolescence. It also pokes fun at tech blogging culture."
  rating: 10

- text: "My IoT toaster is now a security vulnerability. At least my bread stays connected."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurdity of adding internet connectivity to everything (IoT trend) while acknowledging the security issues that come with it. The incongruity of 'connected bread' adds to the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the startup pivot to AI? Their original product was only three weeks old and already considered legacy technology."
  explanation: "This satirizes both startup culture and the AI hype cycle, using the absurd timeframe of three weeks to emphasize how quickly technology trends shift and how companies chase them."
  rating: 8

- text: "I'm not saying technology moves fast, but my 'Next Big Thing' tattoo now says 'Deprecated.'"
  explanation: "This uses personal commitment (a tattoo) as a metaphor for investing in technology trends, with the physical permanence contrasting humorously with the ephemeral nature of tech trends."
  rating: 9

- text: "Blockchain was going to revolutionize everything. Now it revolutionizes nothing, but we still have the whitepapers."
  explanation: "This joke comments on the hype cycle of technology trends, particularly blockchain, where grand promises often exceed actual implementation. The punchline about whitepapers emphasizes that only documentation remains."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer attend the conference on quantum computing? To be confused about technology that won't be practical for another decade instead of technology that's impractical right now."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection and self-awareness about the tech industry's tendency to focus on future technologies while current ones remain challenging. It's humor through honest acknowledgment of collective behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our company uses microservices, serverless, and containers. We still can't figure out why the login button doesn't work."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the irony of adopting cutting-edge architectural patterns while failing at basic functionality, commenting on how trend-chasing can distract from core product needs."
  rating: 10

- text: "I asked my smart home when technology trends would slow down. It said 'I don't know' in seven different languages, then ordered me three books on the subject."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurdity of smart home over-functionality while using the device itself to comment on the question about technology pace. The multi-layered response satirizes AI assistant behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "The metaverse is the future. That's why I'm investing heavily in virtual real estate that doesn't exist in a platform nobody uses yet."
  explanation: "This employs irony and absurdity to satirize speculative technology trends, highlighting the logical disconnect between hype and reality through the contradiction in the statement itself."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do tech companies love the word 'revolutionary'? Because 'this will be irrelevant in six months' doesn't fit on a banner."
  explanation: "This joke exposes the marketing language around technology trends through contrast, using truth-telling as the punchline. It's meta-humor about how the industry talks about itself."
  rating: 10

- text: "My fitness tracker just got a software update. Now it tracks my fitness in the metaverse while mining cryptocurrency and analyzing my DNA. I just wanted to count my steps."
  explanation: "This satirizes feature creep and trend-stacking in technology products, where companies add every buzzword technology to simple devices. The humor comes from the absurd contrast between complex features and simple needs."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a tech trend and a teenager? The teenager eventually matures."
  explanation: "This uses comparison humor to suggest that tech trends often disappear before reaching maturity, unlike teenagers who grow up. It's a clever way to comment on the abandonment of technologies before they're fully developed."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally understand Web3. Just in time for Web4, Web5, and the heat death of the universe."
  explanation: "This employs escalation and cosmic-scale exaggeration to satirize the rapid succession of web technology paradigms. The inclusion of 'heat death of the universe' absurdly suggests that web versions will outlast physical reality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the AI refuse to predict the next big tech trend? It had already been wrong about the last seventeen, and its neural network was developing anxiety."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes AI to create humor while commenting on the unpredictability of tech trends. The idea of an AI developing anxiety is both absurd and relatable, making it a multi-layered joke."
  rating: 8

- text: "I'm starting a support group for developers who learned Angular, then React, then Vue, then Svelte, then went back to jQuery and cried. We meet in a deprecated chat platform that no longer exists."
  explanation: "This is the culmination joke that combines multiple humor elements: the exhausting framework churn, the circular journey back to basics, the emotional toll, and the meta-joke about the support group's platform itself being a victim of technology trends. It's self-referential, absurd, and deeply relatable to anyone in web development."
