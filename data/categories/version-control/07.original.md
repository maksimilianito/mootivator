- text: "I tried to commit my changes, but Git said I had conflicts. Story of my life."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'conflicts' - both Git merge conflicts and personal life conflicts. It's a simple one-liner that connects version control terminology with everyday struggles."

- text: "Why did the developer always use Git? Because SVN was too controlling."
  explanation: "This plays on the centralized nature of SVN versus Git's distributed approach, personifying SVN as 'controlling' like an overbearing relationship partner."

- text: "My code works perfectly on my machine. That's why I never push to master."
  explanation: "This references the classic 'works on my machine' problem and the fear of breaking production code, highlighting a developer's reluctance to share potentially problematic code."

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite Git command? git blame. It's never their fault."
  explanation: "This joke plays on 'git blame' which shows who last modified each line of code, and the human tendency to deflect responsibility for bugs."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A play on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, highlighting the dangerous practice of pushing untested code directly to production without proper version control practices."

- text: "Merge conflicts are just Git's way of saying 'you two need to talk.'"
  explanation: "This personifies Git as a relationship counselor, comparing merge conflicts to communication breakdowns between team members working on the same code."

- text: "Why did the commit message say 'fixed stuff'? Because honesty is the best policy."
  explanation: "This satirizes vague, unhelpful commit messages that many developers write when they're tired or lazy, despite best practices calling for descriptive messages."

- text: "A programmer's wife asks him to pick up a loaf of bread, and if they have eggs, get a dozen. He returns with 12 loaves of bread. 'They had eggs,' he explains. She sighs and runs 'git revert HEAD~1' on their marriage."
  explanation: "This combines the classic programmer logic joke with version control terminology, suggesting the wife wants to undo the last commit (his shopping trip) in their relationship."

- text: "I have a great Git workflow: commit, push, pray, pull, cry, force push."
  explanation: "This describes a chaotic development process that violates best practices, escalating from hope to desperation to the nuclear option of force pushing."

- text: "What's the difference between Git and a time machine? A time machine doesn't judge you for your past mistakes in the commit history."
  explanation: "This plays on Git's permanent record of all changes, including embarrassing code and commit messages that haunt developers forever."

- text: "My repository has 847 branches. I call it my 'Garden of Forking Paths.'"
  explanation: "This references Borges' famous story while highlighting the problem of branch proliferation when teams don't clean up merged or abandoned branches."

- text: "Why don't version control systems ever win at poker? Because they always show their commits."
  explanation: "A pun on 'show their hand' and the transparency of version control systems that track every change made to the codebase."

- text: "I tried to explain Git to my grandma. After three hours, she said 'So it's like Track Changes in Word?' I promoted her to senior architect."
  explanation: "This joke highlights how non-technical people sometimes grasp the essence of complex tools better than developers who overthink them, and satirizes arbitrary promotion practices."

- text: "There are two types of developers: those who write meaningful commit messages and liars who claim they do."
  explanation: "This plays on the universal truth that everyone intends to write good commit messages but often resorts to 'fix', 'update', or 'stuff' when actually committing."

- text: "My coworker's commit history reads like a psychological thriller: 'it works', 'IT WORKS!', 'why doesn't it work', 'please work', 'I give up', 'nevermind it works'."
  explanation: "This captures the emotional rollercoaster of debugging through commit messages, showing how version control inadvertently documents a developer's mental state."

- text: "What do you call a Git repository with no commits? Potential energy. What do you call one with 10,000 commits? Therapy bills."
  explanation: "This uses physics terminology to contrast the promise of a new project with the psychological burden of maintaining a large, complex codebase over time."

- text: "I finally understand Git branching strategies. Trunk-based development means everyone breaks the same branch simultaneously instead of separately."
  explanation: "This satirizes trunk-based development by suggesting it just changes the location of chaos rather than preventing it, showing sophisticated understanding of Git workflows."

- text: "A junior developer, a senior developer, and Git walk into a bar. The junior creates a new branch for ordering drinks. The senior force-pushes everyone out. Git remembers everything and brings it up at the next retrospective."
  explanation: "This joke personifies Git as the team member with perfect memory, while satirizing different developer approaches to problem-solving and the passive-aggressive nature of retrospectives."

- text: "My therapist asked me to describe my relationship with Git. I said 'It's complicated, we have a lot of history, and I'm constantly trying to rebase my expectations.'"
  explanation: "This uses relationship therapy language while incorporating Git terminology (history, rebase), suggesting version control has become as emotionally complex as human relationships."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SVN and marry Git? Because Git supported their distributed lifestyle and didn't require constant connection to feel validated."
  explanation: "This personifies version control systems as relationship partners, with Git being the modern, independent partner versus SVN's neediness (requiring server connection)."

- text: "I told my code it was perfect just the way it was. Then I immediately committed it with the message 'TODO: refactor this garbage before anyone sees it' and pushed to a branch named 'definitely-not-production-ready-do-not-merge-seriously-dave-i-mean-it'."
  explanation: "This captures the contradiction between public confidence and private doubt, the panic of committing imperfect code, and the futile attempt to use branch names as warning labels, all while revealing the universal developer experience of shipping code they know needs work."
