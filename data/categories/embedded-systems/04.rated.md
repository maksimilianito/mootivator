- text: "My IoT device uses 2KB of RAM. 1.5KB is for the bootloader."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the extreme memory constraints in embedded systems where even the bootloader (the tiny program that starts the device) consumes most of the available RAM, leaving almost nothing for the actual application. The absurdity of having so little memory left for functionality is what makes this funny."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the microcontroller go to therapy? It had commitment issues with its watchdog timer."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'commitment issues' - in relationships and in embedded systems where watchdog timers reset the system if it doesn't 'check in' regularly. The humanization of a technical component creates the humor through incongruity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Embedded developers don't have bugs. They have 'timing-dependent features.'"
  explanation: "This joke references the notorious difficulty of debugging timing-related issues in embedded systems, where bugs often appear and disappear based on execution timing. The euphemism 'timing-dependent features' mirrors the classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' excuse."
  rating: 9

- text: "My smart toaster has more computing power than the Apollo missions. It still burns my bread."
  explanation: "This highlights the irony that despite having vastly superior hardware compared to systems that landed humans on the moon, modern IoT devices often fail at their basic functions. The contrast between capability and performance creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know someone works in embedded systems? They'll tell you how many bytes they saved."
  explanation: "This plays on the 'how do you know someone...' joke format, poking fun at embedded developers' obsession with memory optimization. Every single byte matters in resource-constrained systems, making developers proud of even tiny optimizations."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to implement malloc() on my 8-bit microcontroller. Now I understand why embedded developers have trust issues."
  explanation: "Dynamic memory allocation (malloc) is notoriously problematic in embedded systems due to limited RAM and fragmentation issues. The joke connects technical frustration with psychological 'trust issues,' creating humor through personification."
  rating: 8

- text: "Real-time operating system: where 'real-time' means 'right now' and 'operating' is negotiable."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the strict timing requirements of RTOS while acknowledging that embedded systems don't always operate as expected. The wordplay on 'operating' being negotiable undermines the seriousness of real-time guarantees."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't embedded developers use cloud services? Because they're still trying to fit their code in the fog."
  explanation: "This references 'fog computing' (edge computing closer to devices) while playing on the phrase 'lost in the fog.' It highlights the struggle of fitting functionality into tiny embedded systems before even thinking about cloud connectivity."
  rating: 6

- text: "My microcontroller documentation says 'typical' power consumption. I've learned that 'typical' is Latin for 'multiply by three.'"
  explanation: "Datasheets often list 'typical' specifications that rarely match real-world conditions. The joke uses the absurd etymology of 'typical' to express the common experience of actual power consumption being much higher than advertised."
  rating: 8

- text: "Embedded programming: where commenting out a single line can free up 50 bytes and you throw a party."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the celebration of tiny memory savings in embedded development. The absurdity of throwing a party over 50 bytes highlights how different embedded development is from modern software development where memory is abundant."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my IoT device to be more secure. It said 'Error: Not enough flash memory for encryption library.'"
  explanation: "This darkly humorous joke highlights a real problem in IoT security - devices are often too resource-constrained to implement proper security measures. The device's self-aware response adds to the absurdity."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between embedded developers and archaeologists? Archaeologists expect their artifacts to be old."
  explanation: "This joke pokes fun at how embedded systems often run on ancient hardware and decades-old code, but unlike archaeology where age is expected, embedded developers constantly deal with surprisingly outdated technology in 'modern' devices."
  rating: 8

- text: "My smart fridge runs Linux. It takes 45 seconds to boot. My food spoils faster than it initializes."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurdity of using full operating systems in appliances where they're unnecessary. The exaggerated consequence (food spoiling during boot) emphasizes the mismatch between technology choice and application needs."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the embedded developer break up with their partner? They needed more space, but only had 512 bytes left."
  explanation: "This joke uses the relationship phrase 'needed more space' with the literal meaning of storage space in embedded systems. The tiny amount (512 bytes) emphasizes the extreme constraints embedded developers face daily."
  rating: 6

- text: "I optimized my code from 2049 bytes to 2048 bytes. Now it fits in the memory page. I'm putting this on my resume."
  explanation: "Memory pages are fixed-size blocks, and crossing a page boundary can waste significant space. Saving just one byte to fit within a page is a legitimate achievement in embedded systems, making the resume claim both absurd and relatable."
  rating: 9

- text: "IoT stands for 'Internet of Things That Stop Working After the Company Goes Bankrupt.'"
  explanation: "This cynical redefinition addresses a real problem in IoT - devices that depend on cloud services become useless when companies shut down their servers. The acronym reinterpretation makes the criticism memorable and funny."
  rating: 9

- text: "An embedded developer walks into a bar and orders 1.73 beers. The bartender says 'What?' The developer replies, 'Sorry, fixed-point math.'"
  explanation: "Fixed-point arithmetic is used in embedded systems without floating-point units, often leading to precision issues. The absurdity of ordering a fractional beer in the real world highlights the quirks of embedded math."
  rating: 8

- text: "My microcontroller has a Harvard architecture. It's very smart but refuses to talk to its program memory and data memory at the same time."
  explanation: "Harvard architecture separates program and data memory (unlike von Neumann architecture). The personification of the architecture as snobbish and non-communicative creates humor through the academic reference and technical reality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging embedded systems: where adding a printf statement fixes the bug because now the timing is different."
  explanation: "This captures the maddening reality of Heisenbugs in embedded systems - bugs that disappear when you try to observe them. The added delay from debugging code changes timing enough to mask the original problem, creating a paradox."
  rating: 10

- text: "I spent three days optimizing my interrupt handler. It now executes in 47 cycles instead of 50. My manager asked what I accomplished this week. I said 'Everything.'"
  explanation: "This joke contrasts the massive effort required for tiny optimizations in embedded systems with the difficulty of explaining their importance to non-technical managers. The developer's confident 'Everything' response is both absurd and deeply relatable."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do embedded developers make terrible partners? They're always in sleep mode to save power, and when you interrupt them, they take forever to respond and might lose their context entirely."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares embedded system power management (sleep modes, interrupt latency, context switching) to relationship dynamics. The technical accuracy combined with relationship humor makes this work on multiple levels, serving as a perfect finale."
