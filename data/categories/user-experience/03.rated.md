- text: "UX Designer's motto: 'The user is always right... to click the wrong button.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common customer service phrase 'the customer is always right' but subverts it with the reality that users often make unexpected choices in interfaces, highlighting the constant challenge UX designers face in predicting user behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the UX designer use a ladder? To reach the high-level navigation."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'high-level' which in UX refers to top-tier navigation elements, but the punchline takes it literally with a physical ladder, creating incongruity between technical and physical concepts."
  rating: 5

- text: "A user walks into a bar. The UX designer didn't put it there."
  explanation: "This plays on the 'walks into a bar' joke format but adds a UX twist - suggesting poor interface design led to an unexpected collision, representing how bad UX creates obstacles users didn't anticipate."
  rating: 8

- text: "UX testing revealed users prefer the red button. Marketing wants it blue. The button is now purple and nobody's happy."
  explanation: "This joke captures the real-world frustration of design by committee, where compromise leads to solutions that satisfy no one, highlighting the tension between user research and stakeholder opinions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't UX designers like to garden? Too many root directories."
  explanation: "This creates humor through double meaning - 'root' refers both to plant roots in gardening and root directories in information architecture, showing how UX designers think in structural terms even outside work."
  rating: 4

- text: "User feedback: 'Make it pop!' UX Designer's translation: 'I have no idea what I want.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the communication gap between non-technical stakeholders and designers, where vague feedback like 'make it pop' provides no actionable direction, a common frustration in UX work."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many users does it take to test a feature? Five. The sixth will do something no one imagined possible."
  explanation: "This references Nielsen's heuristic that five users find most usability issues, but adds the reality that there's always that one user who breaks your assumptions, emphasizing the unpredictability of user behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "A UX designer's favorite exercise? Wireframing. It's low-fidelity cardio."
  explanation: "This joke plays on 'low-fidelity' (a term for basic wireframes) and 'cardio' (exercise), creating an unexpected connection between design terminology and fitness, using wordplay to highlight the iterative nature of design work."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why was the interface designer always calm? Because they knew how to handle exceptions."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'handle exceptions' - in programming it means error handling, but in everyday language it means dealing with unusual situations, suggesting UX designers are prepared for anything users throw at them."
  rating: 6

- text: "User: 'Where's the save button?' Designer: 'It auto-saves.' User: 'But where do I click to feel productive?'"
  explanation: "This joke reveals a psychological truth about UX - sometimes users want explicit actions even when they're unnecessary, highlighting the gap between efficient design and user expectations for control and feedback."
  rating: 9

- text: "The three states of a button: hover, active, and 'why did the user click that?'"
  explanation: "This lists the technical button states (hover, active) but adds a humorous third state representing designer confusion when users interact with elements in unexpected ways, capturing the unpredictability of user behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "UX Designer's dilemma: Make it simple enough for users, complex enough for stakeholders to feel they got their money's worth."
  explanation: "This joke exposes the tension between good UX principles (simplicity) and business pressures (perceived value), where sometimes the best design looks 'too simple' to justify project budgets."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the user ignore the tooltip? It appeared for 0.5 seconds while they were reading something else, disappeared forever, and contained the only information they actually needed."
  explanation: "This longer-form joke satirizes poor tooltip implementation - appearing too briefly, at the wrong time, and containing critical information that should be more accessible, a common UX anti-pattern."
  rating: 8

- text: "A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it's not that good."
  explanation: "This meta-joke applies humor theory to UX design itself - just as explaining a joke ruins it, needing to explain an interface means it has failed at intuitive design, drawing a parallel between two forms of communication."
  rating: 10

- text: "User testing session: 'Think aloud please.' User: *clicks randomly in complete silence* 'Yeah, it's fine.'"
  explanation: "This captures the frustration of user testing when participants don't verbalize their thought process despite instructions, leaving designers without insight into the decision-making process they need to understand."
  rating: 8

- text: "The UX designer created a perfect interface. Then they added a search bar because users can't find anything, a tutorial because nothing is intuitive, and a help button because the tutorial was too long."
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating absurdity to show how each solution to a UX problem creates new problems, satirizing the reality that even 'perfect' designs need support systems because users are diverse and unpredictable."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the modal dialog break up with the user? It kept getting dismissed without being heard."
  explanation: "This personifies the modal dialog, using relationship metaphor to highlight how users habitually close popups without reading them, representing the challenge of getting users to engage with important information."
  rating: 7

- text: "User: 'This is unintuitive!' Designer: 'It follows Jakob's Law, Fitts's Law, and Hick's Law.' User: 'It also follows Murphy's Law.'"
  explanation: "This joke contrasts established UX principles with Murphy's Law (anything that can go wrong, will), suggesting that despite following best practices, real-world usage always finds unexpected problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "A UX designer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Click here to enter.' There was no button. The designer said, 'Finally, someone understands my pain.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the afterlife scenario to create ultimate irony - even in heaven, the UX designer encounters the same frustration they spent their career trying to prevent, suggesting this pain is eternal and universal."
  rating: 9

- text: "How do you know a UX designer is an optimist? They put 'optional' fields in forms and actually expect users to understand what that means."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the gap between designer intentions and user comprehension, where 'optional' seems clear to designers but often confuses users, highlighting the curse of knowledge that affects UX professionals."
  rating: 7

- text: "A user, a stakeholder, and a UX designer walk into a usability test. The user clicks the logo expecting to go home. The stakeholder says 'Nobody does that.' The designer updates the requirements. This is not a joke, this is Tuesday."
  explanation: "This meta-joke starts with a classic setup but subverts it by declaring it's not a joke but reality, capturing the weekly cycle of discovering user behaviors that contradict stakeholder assumptions, making the mundane nature of this conflict the actual punchline."
