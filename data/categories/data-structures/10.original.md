- text: "My linked list broke up with me. Said I had too many pointers to my ex."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'pointers' - both as references in data structures and as reminders of past relationships. It's a simple one-liner that uses linked list terminology in a dating context."

- text: "Why did the array go to therapy? It had zero-indexing issues."
  explanation: "This uses the classic question-answer format, playing on 'indexing issues' as both a technical term and a psychological problem. The joke references the common confusion around zero-based indexing."

- text: "Trees in computer science are upside down. Explains why my binary search always feels wrong."
  explanation: "This observational humor points out the counterintuitive nature of tree data structures (roots at top, leaves at bottom) and connects it to a feeling of disorientation, using misdirection about what feels 'wrong'."

- text: "I tried to explain recursion to my stack. Now it won't stop talking about itself."
  explanation: "This joke combines two data structure concepts - stacks and recursion - with the human behavior of being self-referential. It's a meta-joke about recursive behavior."

- text: "Why don't hash tables ever win arguments? They can't handle collisions gracefully."
  explanation: "The punchline uses 'collisions' in both its technical sense (hash collisions) and its metaphorical sense (disagreements). The phrase 'handle gracefully' is also technical jargon applied to social situations."

- text: "My queue is so polite. Always lets everyone go first-in, first-out."
  explanation: "This personifies a queue data structure, playing on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) as if it were polite behavior rather than a technical property."

- text: "What's a tree's favorite drink? Root beer."
  explanation: "A simple pun connecting tree data structures (which have roots) with the beverage. It's accessible even to beginners while still being data structure specific."

- text: "I told my circular buffer to get over it. It just kept coming back to the same point."
  explanation: "This uses the circular nature of ring buffers as a metaphor for being stuck in the past or unable to move forward emotionally. The 'same point' works both spatially and metaphorically."

- text: "Why did the graph break up with the tree? Too many relationship constraints."
  explanation: "This plays on the fact that trees are restricted graphs (no cycles, connected), using 'relationship constraints' as both a technical term and a dating problem."

- text: "My heap is a mess. But at least the maximum is always on top."
  explanation: "This joke uses 'heap' as both a data structure and a synonym for 'mess,' while referencing the heap property where the max (or min) element is at the root."

- text: "A programmer's spouse asked: 'Why do you keep talking to your binary tree?' He replied: 'Someone has to listen to both sides.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke plays on binary trees having exactly two children (left and right) as a metaphor for hearing both sides of an argument."

- text: "What did the linked list say after the breakup? 'I've lost all references to you.'"
  explanation: "This uses the technical concept of references/pointers in linked lists as a metaphor for forgetting someone after a relationship ends. The double meaning of 'references' makes it work."

- text: "I implemented a stack of pancakes. Pop() was delicious, but Push() made a mess."
  explanation: "This applies stack operations (push and pop) to a literal stack of pancakes, creating incongruity between the technical and culinary meanings."

- text: "Why are trees so good at family reunions? They keep track of all their ancestors and descendants."
  explanation: "This references tree terminology (ancestors, descendants, parent, child nodes) and applies it to the original metaphor source - family trees."

- text: "My adjacency matrix went to a party and knew exactly who was connected to whom. Still had no friends."
  explanation: "This personifies an adjacency matrix (which stores graph connections) as socially aware but unsuccessful, playing on knowing connections vs. having actual friendships."

- text: "A deque walks into a bar. Bartender says, 'What'll it be?' Deque says, 'I can't decide - I work from both ends.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the double-ended queue property (can add/remove from front or back) as indecisiveness. The bar setting makes it a classic joke format with technical content."

- text: "Why did the programmer use a trie for autocomplete? Because hash tables just weren't his type."
  explanation: "This references the actual use case for tries (autocomplete) while punning on 'type' (data type vs. personal preference) and contrasting data structures."

- text: "I asked my B-tree for relationship advice. It said: 'Stay balanced, keep your children sorted, and when you're full, it's okay to split.'"
  explanation: "This applies B-tree properties (balanced, sorted children, node splitting) as life advice. It's a longer-form joke with multiple layers of meaning that work both technically and metaphorically."

- text: "What's the difference between a graph and my social life? The graph has edges."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke plays on 'edges' as both graph connections and the colloquial 'having an edge' or advantage, implying the speaker has no social connections."

- text: "A skip list walks into an interview. 'What's your complexity?' 'O(log n) average, O(n) worst case.' 'You're hired - you're honest about your worst days.'"
  explanation: "This joke format presents a technical interview scenario, using Big O notation and skip list properties while making it about emotional honesty. It works on multiple levels for different audience sophistication."

- text: "Why do binary search trees make terrible therapists? Patient: 'I feel unbalanced.' BST: 'Have you tried rotating?' Patient: 'That's your solution to everything!'"
  explanation: "This extended dialogue joke uses tree rotation (the actual solution to unbalanced BSTs) as unhelpful therapy advice. It's the culmination of the set, combining technical accuracy with absurdist humor and social commentary."
