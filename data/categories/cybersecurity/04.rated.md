- text: "I changed my password to 'incorrect' so whenever I forget it, the system tells me 'Your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of error messages. The humor comes from the clever but impractical solution to password management, where the user exploits the system's helpful error message by making it literally true."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the hacker break up with their calculator? It had too many problems."
  explanation: "A simple pun using the double meaning of 'problems' - both mathematical problems that calculators solve and relationship problems. The setup suggests a technical reason but delivers a common relationship complaint."
  rating: 4

- text: "My antivirus software is like my gym membership - I paid for it, but I'm not sure it's actually doing anything."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory through self-deprecating humor, comparing two things people pay for but often ignore or don't fully utilize. It reflects common anxiety about whether security software is actually protecting us."
  rating: 7

- text: "A cybersecurity expert walks into a bar, a restaurant, a laundromat, a pet store..."
  explanation: "This references SQL injection attacks where hackers input multiple commands separated by commas. The joke structure mimics the 'walks into a bar' format but demonstrates penetration testing by trying every possible input."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break, and it said 'Access Denied.' Apparently I'm not authorized to rest."
  explanation: "The incongruity comes from applying computer security permissions to human needs. It personifies the computer as an authoritarian manager, reflecting the frustration of overwork in tech culture."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't hackers ever get lost? They always find a backdoor."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay on 'backdoor' - both a physical exit and a security vulnerability that hackers exploit. The joke uses misdirection by setting up a navigation question but delivering a security concept."
  rating: 5

- text: "My password is so strong, even I can't remember it. Mission accomplished?"
  explanation: "This highlights the paradox of password security - making passwords so complex that they're secure from hackers but also inaccessible to legitimate users. It's a common frustration in cybersecurity."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's a hacker's favorite season? Phishing season."
  explanation: "A pun on 'fishing season' and 'phishing' (fraudulent emails). The joke anthropomorphizes hackers as hunters waiting for the right time to catch victims, using familiar seasonal hunting terminology."
  rating: 5

- text: "I have a great password: 'BeefStew'. It's a strong broth."
  explanation: "A multilayered pun playing on 'strong password' and 'strong broth.' The humor comes from the absurd reasoning - choosing a password based on culinary properties rather than security criteria."
  rating: 6

- text: "A firewall and an antivirus walk into a network. The firewall says, 'I'll handle the perimeter.' The antivirus says, 'And I'll clean up your mess.'"
  explanation: "This personifies two security tools and accurately represents their different functions - perimeter defense versus internal threat removal. The humor comes from their relationship dynamic like coworkers with different roles."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the security researcher quit their job? They found too many vulnerabilities in their employment contract."
  explanation: "This applies security thinking to everyday life, suggesting the researcher analyzed their contract like they would analyze code, finding 'exploitable' terms. It's a meta-joke about professional deformation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Two-factor authentication: because your password '123456' needed a sidekick to feel secure."
  explanation: "This uses superiority theory by mocking weak passwords while explaining why 2FA exists. The personification of the password needing a 'sidekick' adds a superhero metaphor to security concepts."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying our company's security is bad, but our 'secure server' is named 'TrustMeBro.'"
  explanation: "The incongruity between professional security standards and casual internet slang ('Trust me bro') creates humor. It suggests catastrophically poor security practices through absurd naming conventions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A hacker tried to steal my identity, but after seeing my credit score, they gave it back and apologized."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that subverts the threat of identity theft. The joke suggests the victim's identity is so worthless that even criminals don't want it, turning a security threat into a personal finance joke."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a security expert who works from home? A remote threat."
  explanation: "A clever double meaning where 'remote threat' is both a security term for external attacks and a description of someone working remotely. The joke works on two technical levels simultaneously."
  rating: 9

- text: "My encryption is so good, I encrypted my encryption key. Now nobody can decrypt anything, including me. Perfect security!"
  explanation: "This highlights the absurdity of over-securing systems to the point of uselessness. It's a reductio ad absurdum of the security principle that demonstrates the balance needed between security and accessibility."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the penetration tester bring a ladder to work? They heard the company had high-level security."
  explanation: "A visual pun on 'high-level' meaning both advanced/sophisticated security and literally elevated/high up. The physical ladder for a metaphorical concept creates absurdist humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked a hacker how they stay so calm under pressure. They said, 'I just keep my composure encrypted - nobody can read my emotions.'"
  explanation: "This applies technical concepts to human psychology, suggesting emotional encryption. It's meta-humor about hacker stereotypes while cleverly using security terminology for personal traits."
  rating: 7

- text: "A security audit revealed our biggest vulnerability: the intern who writes passwords on sticky notes. We've now encrypted the sticky notes."
  explanation: "This escalates the absurdity by solving a human problem with a technical solution that doesn't address the root issue. It satirizes security theater and misguided technical solutions to social problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a security researcher and a burglar? A researcher knocks on your front door, tells you it's unlocked, explains how to fix it, and publishes a paper about it. A burglar just walks in and takes your stuff. Both found the same vulnerability."
  explanation: "This joke explains the ethical distinction in cybersecurity through parallel structure. It uses the superiority theory to elevate security researchers while acknowledging they use similar skills as criminals, addressing a common misconception about ethical hackers."
  rating: 8

- text: "I implemented zero-trust security at home. Now my smart fridge requires biometric authentication, my toaster demands a security token, and my coffee maker won't brew without a VPN connection. I'm very secure and very caffeinated... eventually."
  explanation: "This takes the legitimate security concept of 'zero-trust architecture' to absurd extremes by applying it to household appliances. It satirizes over-engineering security while highlighting the usability problems that come with excessive security measures, ending with the relatable frustration of wanting coffee quickly."
