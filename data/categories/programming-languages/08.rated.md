- text: "Python is the only language where whitespace can break your code and your spirit."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Python's unique use of indentation for code blocks, which is both a defining feature and a common source of frustration for developers. The parallel structure of 'code and spirit' creates humor through escalation from technical to emotional."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#!"
  explanation: "A classic wordplay joke using the double meaning of 'C#' (the programming language) and 'see sharp' (having clear vision). The setup misdirects toward JavaScript, making the punchline unexpected."
  rating: 5

- text: "Assembly language: where 'MOV' means everything and nothing simultaneously."
  explanation: "This references how the MOV instruction in assembly is used for countless operations, creating humor through the philosophical paradox of a single command having infinite interpretations."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a SQL query and uses the technical term 'JOIN' as both a database operation and a social request, creating humor through the incongruity of applying database logic to a social situation."
  rating: 7

- text: "Perl: Write once, read never."
  explanation: "A twist on the 'write once, run anywhere' slogan, this jokes about Perl's notorious reputation for producing code that becomes incomprehensible even to its own author, using concise parallel structure for impact."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C++."
  explanation: "Similar to the JavaScript joke but with different languages, playing on the rivalry between Java and C++ while using the 'see' pun. The joke works on multiple levels for those familiar with language wars."
  rating: 4

- text: "In Haskell, side effects are like vampires: they can't come in unless you explicitly invite them."
  explanation: "This uses a pop culture metaphor to explain Haskell's pure functional programming paradigm where side effects must be explicitly managed through monads, making a complex concept humorous through unexpected comparison."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the C programmer get confused at the funeral? Because they couldn't tell if it was a pointer or a reference."
  explanation: "This plays on C's notoriously confusing pointer syntax and the double meaning of 'reference' (both a technical term and a funeral concept), creating humor through the inappropriate application of programming logic."
  rating: 6

- text: "COBOL: The language where your code is so verbose, it needs its own table of contents."
  explanation: "This exaggerates COBOL's famously wordy syntax, comparing programs to books that require navigation aids. The absurdity of code needing a table of contents creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A programmer's spouse says, 'While you're at the store, get milk.' They never returned."
  explanation: "This jokes about the 'while' loop in programming, where the condition creates an infinite loop. The dark humor comes from the literal interpretation of natural language as code, with tragic consequences."
  rating: 10

- text: "Rust: The language that makes you feel like you're arguing with a very pedantic friend who's always right."
  explanation: "This personifies Rust's strict borrow checker, capturing the frustration and ultimate appreciation developers feel. The 'always right' part acknowledges that Rust's strictness prevents bugs."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Go developer refuse to handle errors? They were too busy ignoring them with 'if err != nil'."
  explanation: "This satirizes Go's controversial error handling pattern where 'if err != nil' appears repeatedly. The irony is that the developer is actually handling errors while claiming to ignore them."
  rating: 7

- text: "PHP: A language designed by a committee that never met."
  explanation: "This explains PHP's inconsistent naming conventions and design decisions through an absurd scenario. The joke captures the feeling that PHP's quirks seem random and uncoordinated."
  rating: 8

- text: "In Lisp, the parentheses aren't just syntax; they're a lifestyle, a philosophy, and occasionally, a cry for help."
  explanation: "This escalates from technical observation to existential crisis, joking about Lisp's heavy use of parentheses. The humor comes from treating punctuation as something profound and overwhelming."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do TypeScript developers sleep better? Because their code has type safety blankets."
  explanation: "This creates a comforting metaphor comparing TypeScript's type system to security blankets, playing on the dual meaning of 'safety' and creating a wholesome image of protected code."
  rating: 7

- text: "A Brainfuck programmer walks into a bar. The bartender says, '++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses actual Brainfuck code as the punchline, making it incomprehensible to most readers. The humor lies in the absurdity of using an intentionally difficult esoteric language for simple communication."
  rating: 6

- text: "Kotlin: Java's apology letter, written in a more elegant font."
  explanation: "This personifies Kotlin as Java's way of saying sorry for its verbosity and limitations. The 'elegant font' metaphor suggests superficial improvement while acknowledging genuine enhancement."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Fortran developer refuse to retire? Because arrays started at 1, and they weren't ready to start at 0."
  explanation: "This plays on Fortran's 1-based array indexing versus most modern languages' 0-based indexing, using it as a metaphor for resistance to change and generational differences in programming."
  rating: 7

- text: "Swift: Where the only thing more optional than your syntax is your job security if you pick the wrong Apple platform."
  explanation: "This makes a dark joke about Swift's optional types while also commenting on the risks of platform-specific development. The parallel structure between technical and career uncertainty creates layered humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A C++ programmer walks into a bar, orders a beer, and destructs it before drinking. The bartender asks why. 'RAII,' they reply, 'Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, but nobody said anything about consumption.'"
  explanation: "This creates an absurd scenario where RAII principles are applied too literally to real life. The joke works on multiple levels: the technical accuracy of RAII, the absurdity of the application, and the programmer's deadpan explanation."
  rating: 9

- text: "Scala: A language where every developer has their own dialect, and they're all convinced theirs is the only correct oneâ€”like Italian, but with more monads and fewer hand gestures."
  explanation: "This compares Scala's flexibility and multiple paradigms to regional language variations, creating humor through cultural comparison. The specific mention of 'monads' and 'hand gestures' adds concrete detail that makes the abstraction funnier."
