- text: "My first program printed 'Hello, World!' My second program printed 'Goodbye, Cruel World!'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the traditional first program every beginner writes, contrasting the optimism of starting to code with the frustration that quickly follows when encountering actual programming challenges."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the student's code work on the first try? It didn't."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection to subvert expectations - the question implies success, but the punchline reveals the universal truth that code rarely works perfectly on the first attempt, especially for students."
  rating: 6

- text: "Learning to code is easy. Said no one who learned to code."
  explanation: "This employs the 'said no one' format to highlight the gap between how programming is marketed versus the actual difficulty students experience."
  rating: 5

- text: "My programming teacher said I could be anything I wanted. So I became undefined."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning - 'undefined' both as a life philosophy and as the common programming error students encounter when variables aren't properly initialized."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a computer science student and a philosopher? The philosopher knows they know nothing. The CS student's code proves it."
  explanation: "This superiority theory joke plays on Socratic wisdom while highlighting how buggy student code serves as evidence of the learning process."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my programming instructor how long it would take to learn Python. He said 'import time.'"
  explanation: "This wordplay joke works on two levels - the literal Python import statement and the actual answer about time, demonstrating how programming humor requires understanding of syntax."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do programming students love Git? Because it lets them blame their past selves."
  explanation: "This relief theory joke addresses the common student experience of writing bad code and later discovering it through version control, providing a safe way to acknowledge mistakes."
  rating: 8

- text: "My bootcamp promised I'd be job-ready in 12 weeks. They were right - I'm ready to get a job to pay off the bootcamp."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity between the promise of career transformation and the economic reality many coding bootcamp students face, creating humor through unexpected reframing."
  rating: 9

- text: "A student's code either works and they don't know why, or it doesn't work and they don't know why. Either way, they copy it to Stack Overflow."
  explanation: "This joke captures the student experience of uncertainty while also referencing the common practice of seeking help online, with an absurd twist about posting rather than searching."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a programming student who actually reads the documentation? A liar."
  explanation: "This plays on the stereotype that students (and developers) avoid reading documentation, using exaggeration for comedic effect while acknowledging a real learning behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "My professor said 'There are no stupid questions in programming.' Then I asked if I should delete System32 to free up space."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the classic setup-punchline structure, where the reassuring statement is immediately contradicted by a genuinely dangerous question that reveals the student's lack of knowledge."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programming student fail their exam? They spent three hours optimizing code that didn't work instead of making code that worked badly."
  explanation: "This highlights the common student mistake of premature optimization, using incongruity between effort and outcome to create humor about misplaced priorities."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying my first programming teacher was old, but they taught us to code in Latin."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke exaggerates the generation gap in tech education while playing on the stereotype of ancient programming languages being as dead as Latin."
  rating: 6

- text: "A programming student walks into a bar. They walk into another bar. They should probably learn to handle exceptions."
  explanation: "This uses the classic 'walks into a bar' joke format but subverts it with programming logic, where the repeated action suggests a loop without proper error handling."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code review from my instructor said 'This works, but at what cost?' I checked - the cost was my entire weekend and my sanity."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the double meaning of 'cost' - both the computational complexity instructors worry about and the very real personal toll students experience while learning."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't programming students trust stairs? Because they're always incrementing and never breaking properly."
  explanation: "This sophisticated wordplay combines physical reality with programming concepts (increment operators and break statements), creating layered humor that rewards technical knowledge."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my CS professor I was having an identity crisis. He said 'Have you tried checking if you're null first?'"
  explanation: "This applies programming logic to emotional problems, creating humor through the incongruity of treating existential questions with technical debugging approaches."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a tutorial project and a student's actual project? About 47 unhandled edge cases and a prayer."
  explanation: "This captures the gap between guided learning and independent work, using specific exaggeration ('47') and the absurd addition of 'prayer' to highlight student desperation."
  rating: 9

- text: "My programming bootcamp had a 100% job placement rate. Turns out 'job' includes 'unpaid internship debugging legacy code written by the last unpaid intern.'"
  explanation: "This uses dark humor and misdirection to expose misleading educational marketing, with the recursive nature of exploited interns adding an extra layer of absurdity."
  rating: 10

- text: "A student debugs their code for six hours, finally finds the missing semicolon, and experiences every human emotion simultaneously. This is called 'graduating.'"
  explanation: "This joke captures the intense emotional journey of programming education, using hyperbole and the unexpected reframing of a simple syntax error as a profound educational milestone."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programming students make terrible magicians? Because when they make something disappear, they can't make it reappear without checking Stack Overflow for 'how to undo git rm.'"
  explanation: "This combines multiple layers - the magician metaphor, the common student mistake of deleting files, the reliance on Stack Overflow, and specific Git knowledge - creating sophisticated humor that builds to an absurdly specific but universally relatable punchline."
