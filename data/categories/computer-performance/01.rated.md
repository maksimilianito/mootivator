- text: "My code runs faster on Fridays. Must be the weekend approaching."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the absurdity of code performance being affected by the day of the week, when in reality it's likely just confirmation bias or wishful thinking from a tired developer."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the algorithm go to the gym? It wanted to reduce its complexity."
  explanation: "A play on Big O notation and algorithmic complexity, where 'reducing complexity' has both a technical meaning (making code more efficient) and a physical fitness meaning."
  rating: 7

- text: "I optimized my code so much, it now finishes before it starts."
  explanation: "An absurd exaggeration of optimization efforts, suggesting the impossible scenario of negative execution time, poking fun at developers' obsession with performance."
  rating: 8

- text: "The first rule of optimization: Don't. The second rule: Don't yet."
  explanation: "This references the famous programming wisdom about premature optimization being the root of all evil, presented in the style of Fight Club's rules."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't quantum computers get invited to speed competitions? They're always in a superposition of winning and losing."
  explanation: "A physics joke that plays on quantum superposition while commenting on the current state of quantum computing performance versus classical computers."
  rating: 7

- text: "My database query is so slow, I've started a family while waiting for results."
  explanation: "Hyperbolic humor about database performance issues, exaggerating wait times to an absurd degree that any developer who's dealt with slow queries can relate to."
  rating: 8

- text: "I found the bottleneck! It was between the chair and the keyboard."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke using the classic 'PEBCAK' (Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard) concept, suggesting the developer themselves is the performance issue."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer's code run faster after lunch? He finally removed the breakpoints."
  explanation: "A pun on 'break' having multiple meanings - taking a lunch break and debugging breakpoints that literally stop code execution."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our server is so fast, it responds to requests before they're made. We call them 'pre-sponses.'"
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that invents a portmanteau while suggesting impossible performance levels, mocking the arms race of speed optimization."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote a program to optimize my code. Now I'm waiting for the optimizer to finish."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about the irony of optimization tools themselves being slow, creating a recursive problem where the solution is part of the problem."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the cache miss? It had commitment issues."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizing cache behavior with relationship terminology, playing on 'cache miss' as a technical term and emotional unavailability."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code is like a fine wine - it gets slower with age and everyone complains about it."
  explanation: "Subverts the positive 'fine wine' metaphor by applying it to software degradation, technical debt, and performance regression over time."
  rating: 9

- text: "How many CPU cycles does it take to change a lightbulb? Depends on your O(n) implementation."
  explanation: "Combines a classic joke format with Big O notation, suggesting even simple tasks can have terrible performance depending on implementation."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code's performance, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "Uses the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format to highlight the terrible but relatable practice of discovering performance issues only after deployment."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our system handles millions of requests per second! The problem is we're only getting dozens."
  explanation: "A twist on typical performance bragging, where the punchline reveals that over-optimization for scale that doesn't exist is a form of premature optimization."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the parallel processing job fail? Too many threads arguing about who goes first."
  explanation: "Personifies threading issues and race conditions as interpersonal conflicts, making the technical concept of concurrency problems more relatable."
  rating: 7

- text: "I optimized my code from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes three weeks to run."
  explanation: "Highlights the disconnect between theoretical performance improvements and practical results when dealing with massive datasets or poor absolute performance."
  rating: 8

- text: "The speed of light is just a suggestion to my API timeout settings."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor suggesting timeout values so large they exceed physical laws, mocking overly generous timeout configurations that mask performance issues."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer optimize the wrong function? Because the profiler output was too slow to read."
  explanation: "Meta-humor where the performance analysis tool itself has performance issues, creating a catch-22 situation that's both absurd and surprisingly relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code runs at O(1) complexity. The '1' stands for '1 hour per operation.'"
  explanation: "Subverts Big O notation by pretending constant time is good while revealing the constant is astronomically large, showing that notation alone doesn't guarantee good performance."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally found the memory leak! Turns out I was storing every mistake I've ever made. No wonder it was so large."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that personifies a technical problem (memory leak) as emotional baggage, combining programming frustration with existential humor about developer imperfection."
