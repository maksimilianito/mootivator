```yaml
- text: "My SQL query returned 0 rows. Guess it's working as expected."
  explanation: "This plays on the common developer experience where an empty result set is often the correct outcome, but it's delivered with deadpan irony suggesting disappointment. The humor comes from the incongruity between expecting data and accepting emptiness as 'success.'"

- text: "Why did the database administrator leave the party early? Too many table joins."
  explanation: "A simple pun exploiting the double meaning of 'table' (furniture vs. database table) and 'joins' (social gathering vs. SQL JOIN operations). The joke uses misdirection by setting up a social scenario that resolves with technical terminology."

- text: "I asked my database for a date. It gave me a timestamp."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'date' as both a romantic outing and a data type. The database's literal interpretation creates humor through incongruity - it responds technically when a human context was implied."

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- 0 rows returned"
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke formatted as actual SQL with a comment showing the result. The humor lies in querying for users with a clue (common sense) and finding none, implying the developer community lacks common sense - a playful jab at ourselves."

- text: "My queries are so slow, they're basically philosophical questions about the nature of data."
  explanation: "This joke transforms a technical problem (slow query performance) into an absurdist observation. The incongruity between practical database operations and deep philosophical inquiry creates humor while acknowledging a common frustration."

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? They always show their indexes."
  explanation: "A pun on 'showing your hand' in poker versus database indexes. The joke anthropomorphizes databases while playing with the double meaning of revealing information, creating a simple but effective technical wordplay."

- text: "I tried to optimize my query, but it's still running. Started it last Tuesday."
  explanation: "Exaggeration humor about query performance. The absurd timeframe (days for a single query) amplifies a common developer frustration. The casual tone ('last Tuesday') contrasts with the severity of the problem."

- text: "What's a database's favorite music? Table Rock."
  explanation: "A straightforward pun combining 'table' (database tables) with 'Table Rock' (a play on rock music genres). Simple wordplay that requires minimal technical knowledge, making it accessible while remaining database-themed."

- text: "My JOIN statement walked into a bar, sat down at two tables, and tried to order from both menus simultaneously."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes a SQL JOIN operation, creating a visual metaphor that explains the technical concept through absurdist humor. The physical impossibility mirrors the conceptual complexity of joins."

- text: "I don't always test my queries in production, but when I do, I use SELECT *."
  explanation: "A parody of the 'Most Interesting Man' meme combined with two database anti-patterns: testing in production and using SELECT *. The humor comes from acknowledging terrible practices with mock bravado."

- text: "Why did the INNER JOIN go to therapy? It had abandonment issues with NULL values."
  explanation: "This personifies SQL operations, giving INNER JOIN human psychological problems. The technical accuracy (INNER JOINs exclude NULLs) combines with absurdist psychology humor, creating layered comedy."

- text: "My database has trust issues. Every query needs three credentials and a background check."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizing database security as psychological problems. The exaggeration of security requirements (background check for a query) creates absurdist humor while commenting on over-complicated authentication systems."

- text: "I wrote a query so complex, it asked ME for clarification."
  explanation: "Role reversal humor where the tool becomes smarter than the user. This plays on the frustration of writing overly complicated queries and the fantasy of databases having agency to question poor decisions."

- text: "What do you call a database that's always lying? A fabrication table."
  explanation: "A sophisticated pun on 'fabrication' (lying) and 'table' (database structure). The joke works on multiple levels - technical terminology combined with the concept of dishonesty creates an unexpected connection."

- text: "My LEFT JOIN is so inclusive, it brings along data I didn't even know existed."
  explanation: "This plays on LEFT JOIN behavior (returning all left table rows plus matches) by framing it as excessive inclusivity. The surprise element is discovering unexpected data, turned into a personality trait."

- text: "I told my junior developer to normalize the database. He made it feel really good about itself."
  explanation: "A clever double meaning of 'normalize' - the technical database process versus psychological normalization (making something feel normal/good). The misdirection from technical instruction to emotional support creates the humor."

- text: "Why did the query go to the gym? To get better execution performance."
  explanation: "A pun on 'execution' (running a query vs. performing an action) and 'performance' (query speed vs. athletic ability). The personification of queries as health-conscious beings adds an absurdist layer."

- text: "My database relationship status: It's complicated. Literally. Foreign keys everywhere."
  explanation: "This brilliantly merges social media relationship terminology with database relationships. The word 'complicated' works both colloquially and technically, while 'foreign keys everywhere' suggests complex interconnections in both contexts."

- text: "I tried to teach my database about recursion, but it just kept referring back to this sentence about trying to teach my database about recursion."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that demonstrates recursion through its own structure. The sentence loops back on itself, creating both an explanation and example of recursive behavior - sophisticated self-referential humor."

- text: "What's the difference between a database administrator and a magician? A magician makes things disappear on purpose."
  explanation: "Dark humor about accidental data deletion. The setup suggests similarity between two professions, but the punchline reveals DBAs' accidental destructiveness versus magicians' intentional illusions - playing on the superiority theory through shared fear."

- text: "My query optimizer is so aggressive, it optimized away the actual data I needed. Now it returns instantly with nothing."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor about over-optimization leading to uselessness. The logical extreme of query optimization (removing the data itself) creates a paradox - technically fast but functionally worthless. This sophisticated joke comments on the balance between performance and utility."
