- text: "Our sprint planning meetings are now called 'sprint hoping' meetings."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the cynical reality that many development teams can't accurately predict their work, so instead of 'planning' with confidence, they're merely 'hoping' things will work out. It's a simple word substitution that reveals a common frustration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do we call it 'technical debt'? Because like real debt, we keep making minimum payments and hoping it goes away."
  explanation: "This uses the incongruity between how financial debt and technical debt are handled - both accumulate interest, both get ignored, and both eventually become overwhelming. The humor comes from the uncomfortable truth that technical debt is often managed as poorly as personal finances."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our code review process is very democratic - everyone gets to say 'looks good to me' without reading it."
  explanation: "This joke employs irony by praising a 'democratic' process that's actually dysfunctional. It highlights the common practice of rubber-stamping code reviews, where the form is followed but not the substance."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer? A junior says 'it works on my machine.' A senior says 'it works in my container.'"
  explanation: "This joke shows progression in the field through the lens of the classic 'works on my machine' problem. The punchline suggests that seniors haven't solved the problem, they've just added a layer of abstraction to the excuse."
  rating: 9

- text: "We practice Agile development - we're agile at changing which methodology we're using."
  explanation: "A meta-joke about Agile methodology itself, this plays on how companies often jump between frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe) without mastering any, ironically being 'agile' only in their inconsistency."
  rating: 9

- text: "Documentation is like sex - when it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad, it's still better than nothing."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses an unexpected comparison to highlight the universal frustration with documentation quality. Even poor documentation provides some value, though everyone wishes for better."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our definition of 'done' has more exceptions than a try-catch block in production."
  explanation: "This joke combines software development process terminology with programming concepts. It suggests that the team's 'definition of done' is so riddled with special cases that it's essentially meaningless, like error handling that catches everything."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the development team switch to continuous deployment? So bugs could reach production continuously."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection - the setup suggests a positive reason for adopting CI/CD, but the punchline reveals an unintended consequence. It's a cynical take on how modern practices can backfire without proper quality controls."
  rating: 8

- text: "Waterfall development: Where you can watch your project go over the edge in slow motion."
  explanation: "This visual metaphor plays on the 'waterfall' name itself, suggesting that the methodology's linear nature means you can see disaster coming but can't stop it. The humor comes from the helplessness implied."
  rating: 7

- text: "We've achieved DevOps nirvana - now developers and operations are equally miserable."
  explanation: "This subverts the promise of DevOps culture (breaking down silos, improving collaboration) by suggesting it just distributed the suffering evenly. The 'nirvana' reference adds ironic contrast to the actual outcome."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a prototype and production code? About three years and a lot of apologies."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common sin of technical debt - prototypes that never get rewritten become the foundation of production systems. The 'apologies' reference suggests ongoing maintenance nightmares."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our standup meetings are so long, we should call them 'sit-down-you're-going-to-be-here-a-while' meetings."
  explanation: "This plays on the core principle of standup meetings (being brief) by suggesting they've become the opposite. The verbose alternative name mirrors the verbose meetings themselves."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers love pair programming? Because misery loves company, and debugging loves witnesses."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning structure - pair programming is meant to improve code quality, but the punchline suggests its real value is having someone to share the pain of debugging with."
  rating: 8

- text: "We follow test-driven development religiously - we pray our tests will pass."
  explanation: "This plays on the word 'religiously' which means both 'strictly' and relates to prayer. It suggests that instead of writing good tests that ensure quality, the team hopes their tests will somehow work out, undermining TDD's purpose."
  rating: 8

- text: "Scrum master: Someone who removes impediments by scheduling meetings about impediments."
  explanation: "This is a satirical definition that highlights how process can become counterproductive. The irony is that meetings themselves become the impediment while supposedly addressing other impediments."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why was the kanban board arrested? For holding too many things in progress."
  explanation: "This personifies a kanban board and uses the concept of WIP (Work In Progress) limits, which are a core kanban principle. The 'arrest' suggests the board is guilty of the very thing it's supposed to prevent."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our retrospectives are very productive - we produce the same action items every sprint."
  explanation: "This joke uses the word 'productive' ironically. Retrospectives should drive improvement, but the punchline reveals they're just performative rituals where nothing actually changes."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a developer who actually reads the requirements before coding? Unemployed. He's too slow."
  explanation: "This dark humor joke criticizes the pressure to move fast over doing things right. It suggests that taking time to understand requirements is punished rather than rewarded in dysfunctional development cultures."
  rating: 9

- text: "We've achieved perfect continuous integration - our build has been continuously failing for three weeks."
  explanation: "This uses the 'continuous' in CI/CD literally but incorrectly. The joke is that consistency (continuous failure) is being mistaken for success, highlighting how teams can lose sight of actual goals while following processes."
  rating: 8

- text: "A product owner, a scrum master, and a developer walk into a bar. The product owner orders a drink for next sprint, the scrum master facilitates the ordering process, and the developer is still there from the last sprint trying to finish their drink."
  explanation: "This is a walking-into-a-bar joke format that perfectly captures the dynamics and frustrations of Scrum roles - unrealistic planning, process overhead, and developers drowning in work that never ends."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the team abandon Agile? They realized they were being agile at producing technical debt, agile at scope creep, and agile at burnout - just not agile at delivering value."
  explanation: "This is the culmination joke that deconstructs Agile's promises. It uses repetition of 'agile' to show how teams can follow Agile practices while missing the entire point, being efficient only at dysfunction. The multiple layers of failure make it both funny and painfully relatable."
