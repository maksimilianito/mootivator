- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#!"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke using the double meaning of 'see sharp' (needing vision correction) and 'C#' (the programming language), while featuring JavaScript as the setup to create contrast between different programming languages."
  rating: 4

- text: "Assembly: where 'hello world' takes 50 lines and your sanity."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the low-level nature of Assembly language, where even the simplest programs require extensive code compared to high-level languages, playing on the frustration and mental toll of working at such a low level of abstraction."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a SQL query and uses the double meaning of 'join' (both the social act of joining people and the SQL JOIN operation that combines tables), creating a scenario where database operations become social interactions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't see sharp."
  explanation: "A play on the rivalry between Java and C# programming languages, using the homophone 'see sharp' to suggest Java developers have poor vision, while simultaneously referencing C#'s name and the competitive relationship between these languages."
  rating: 5

- text: "Perl: Write once, read never."
  explanation: "A twist on Java's old motto 'Write once, run anywhere,' this joke references Perl's reputation for producing code that's notoriously difficult to read and maintain, even for the original author, due to its flexible and often cryptic syntax."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because they didn't Node how to Express themselves."
  explanation: "This joke combines wordplay with technical references, using 'Node' (Node.js runtime) and 'Express' (Express.js framework) in place of 'know' and 'express,' creating a pun that works on both linguistic and technical levels."

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks, 'Could you go to the store and get a liter of milk? And if they have eggs, get six.' The programmer returns with six liters of milk. The spouse asks, 'Why did you get so much milk?' The programmer replies, 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "This joke illustrates how programmers think in terms of conditional logic (if-then statements), where the condition 'if they have eggs' modifies the entire instruction, leading to a literal interpretation that differs from normal human communication patterns."
  rating: 9

- text: "C++: giving you enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot."
  explanation: "This combines two programming idioms: 'enough rope to hang yourself' (dangerous freedom) and 'shoot yourself in the foot' (self-inflicted errors), highlighting C++'s power and complexity that allows developers to create both brilliant solutions and catastrophic bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers prefer Rust? Because in C they always get tetanus."
  explanation: "A multilayered pun connecting the programming language Rust with the medical condition caused by the element iron (C is also iron's chemical symbol), while referencing C's reputation for memory safety issues (like the 'tetanus' of undefined behavior)."
  rating: 7

- text: "COBOL: The language that refuses to die, like a zombie in enterprise systems, shambling through mainframes since 1959."
  explanation: "This joke uses the zombie metaphor to describe COBOL's surprising longevity in banking and government systems despite being considered outdated, highlighting the reality that legacy systems continue to run critical infrastructure decades after the language's creation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Haskell programmer get lost? Because they couldn't handle the side effects of asking for directions."
  explanation: "This references Haskell's pure functional programming paradigm where side effects are carefully controlled and isolated, creating humor by applying this technical constraint to a real-world scenario where interaction (a side effect) is necessary."
  rating: 7

- text: "In Lisp, the parentheses aren't a bug, they're a feature. A feature that makes you question your life choices."
  explanation: "This plays on the infamous phrase 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' while addressing Lisp's distinctive syntax that uses extensive parentheses (sometimes called 'lots of irritating superfluous parentheses'), which can be overwhelming for newcomers."
  rating: 8

- text: "PHP: A fractal of bad design where every zoom level reveals new horrors, yet somehow powers half the internet."
  explanation: "This uses the mathematical concept of fractals (self-similar patterns at every scale) to describe PHP's design inconsistencies, while acknowledging the paradox that despite widespread criticism, PHP remains incredibly popular and powers major platforms like WordPress and Facebook."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do Go developers never get lost? Because they have channels for everything, but still panic when things go wrong."
  explanation: "This references Go's concurrency features (channels for communication between goroutines) and its error handling philosophy that includes the 'panic' function, creating a scenario where technical features are applied to navigation while maintaining the technical terminology."

- text: "A C programmer, a C++ programmer, and a Rust programmer walk into a bar. The C programmer orders a beer and immediately forgets to free the glass. The C++ programmer orders a beer, wraps it in a smart pointer, and lectures everyone about RAII. The Rust programmer tries to order a beer but the bartender says, 'Sorry, that beer was already borrowed mutably.'"
  explanation: "This joke contrasts memory management approaches across three systems languages: C's manual memory management (prone to leaks), C++'s RAII pattern with smart pointers, and Rust's borrow checker that prevents memory issues at compile time, using a social scenario to illustrate technical concepts."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the Scala developer bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the learning curve was steep, but they didn't expect it to be vertical."
  explanation: "This visualizes the metaphor of a 'learning curve' literally, with Scala's reputation for complexity requiring a ladder to climb, escalating from merely 'steep' to completely 'vertical' to emphasize the language's combination of object-oriented and functional paradigms that many find challenging."
  rating: 7

- text: "TypeScript: JavaScript's way of saying, 'I'm sorry for everything, let me make it up to you with types. Please don't leave me for Rust.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes TypeScript as JavaScript's apologetic response to its dynamic typing issues, framing it as a relationship where JavaScript tries to win back developers who are tempted by more type-safe languages like Rust, reflecting real trends in the programming community."
  rating: 8

- text: "A Ruby developer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'Welcome! Everything here is beautiful and elegant.' The developer asks, 'Is there a hell?' St. Peter nods. 'Yes, that's where they use Ruby on Rails without tests.' The developer gasps, 'That's not hell, that's every startup I've ever worked for!'"
  explanation: "This joke layers multiple concepts: Ruby's philosophy of beauty and elegance, Rails' convention-over-configuration approach, the critical importance of testing in Rails applications, and the reality of startup culture where best practices are often sacrificed for speed, creating a humorous commentary on industry practices."

- text: "Why did the Kotlin developer break up with Java? Because Kotlin said, 'It's not me, it's definitely you. Your verbosity, your null pointers, your checked exceptions—I can't even. I'm moving in with Android, and you're not invited.'"
  explanation: "This frames the relationship between Kotlin and Java as a breakup, referencing specific technical grievances (verbose syntax, null pointer exceptions, checked exceptions) and the real-world situation where Google made Kotlin a first-class language for Android development, essentially choosing Kotlin over Java."

- text: "In Swift, optionals are like Schrödinger's cat: the variable both has a value and doesn't have a value until you unwrap it. Except if you force unwrap it carelessly, the cat is definitely dead, and so is your app."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines quantum mechanics (Schrödinger's cat thought experiment) with Swift's optional type system, where values can be nil or contain a value. The force unwrapping operator (!) can crash the app if used on nil, making the consequence more certain and catastrophic than the quantum superposition."

- text: "A programmer fluent in twenty languages walks into a job interview. The interviewer asks, 'Do you know the language we use here?' The programmer confidently replies, 'Yes! I spent all weekend learning it.' The interviewer smiles and says, 'Great! We use English for communication. How are your soft skills?' The programmer's face goes blank, then throws a NullPointerException."
  explanation: "This joke subverts expectations by revealing the 'language' in question is English (human language), not a programming language, highlighting the stereotype that programmers focus on technical skills while neglecting communication abilities. The punchline uses a Java exception type to describe a human social failure, bringing the humor full circle by applying programming concepts to human interaction."
