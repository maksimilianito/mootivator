- text: "My first SQL query returned no results. Turns out I needed a WHERE clause, not a WISH clause."
  explanation: "This joke plays on beginner confusion between SQL syntax and wishful thinking. The humor comes from the relatable experience of expecting data to magically appear without proper filtering conditions."

- text: "Why did the database administrator go to therapy? Too many relationship issues."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'relationships' refers both to database table relationships (foreign keys, joins) and personal relationships, creating an unexpected connection between technical and personal contexts."

- text: "I tried to tell a joke about NULL values, but nothing came of it."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses the concept of NULL (representing absence of value in databases) to describe the joke itself having no punchline, creating a self-referential humor about database concepts."

- text: "My queries are like my coffee - full of joins and taking way too long to finish."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses the double meaning of 'joins' (SQL operations and social gatherings) while highlighting the common frustration of slow query performance."

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- Returns empty set"
  explanation: "A self-deprecating SQL comment joke suggesting that querying for users with any clue returns nothing, playing on the superiority theory while formatted as actual SQL code."

- text: "What's a database administrator's favorite dance? The INNER JOIN shuffle - everyone needs a partner."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes the INNER JOIN operation, which only returns matching records from both tables, comparing it to a dance where partners are required."

- text: "I don't always test my queries in production, but when I do, I forget the WHERE clause on my DELETE statement."
  explanation: "A meme-format joke referencing the catastrophic mistake of deleting all table data by forgetting to specify which rows to delete, playing on common DBA nightmares."

- text: "Why do SQL queries make terrible comedians? Their timing is always off and they keep dropping tables."
  explanation: "A double-meaning joke where 'timing' refers to query performance and comedic timing, while 'dropping tables' means both physical clumsiness and the SQL DROP TABLE command."

- text: "My database has commitment issues - it keeps rolling back our relationship."
  explanation: "This personification joke uses the database transaction concept of ROLLBACK (undoing changes) as a metaphor for relationship problems, creating humor through the incongruity of technical and romantic contexts."

- text: "What did the LEFT JOIN say to the INNER JOIN? 'I'm more inclusive than you - I keep everyone, even the lonely ones.'"
  explanation: "This joke personifies different JOIN types, highlighting how LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table even without matches, versus INNER JOIN's requirement for matching records in both tables."

- text: "I wrote a query so complex it needed its own query to explain it. We call that a SELECT-ception."
  explanation: "A portmanteau combining SELECT statements with the movie 'Inception,' playing on the concept of nested queries (subqueries) and the absurdity of queries explaining queries."

- text: "Why did the junior developer cry after writing their first JOIN? They finally understood why everyone said relationships are complicated."
  explanation: "This joke uses the emotional journey of learning database relationships, connecting the technical difficulty of understanding JOINs with the cultural phrase about complicated relationships."

- text: "My SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "A classic 'walks into a bar' joke structure adapted for databases, with the word 'tables' working both as bar furniture and database tables, while JOIN becomes both a social and SQL action."

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's queries? The junior uses SELECT *. The senior uses SELECT * and comments 'TODO: fix this later.'"
  explanation: "A self-aware joke about the bad practice of selecting all columns (SELECT *), showing that even experienced developers sometimes take shortcuts while at least acknowledging it's wrong."

- text: "I tried to optimize my query with an index, but it just pointed me back to the documentation."
  explanation: "A wordplay joke using 'index' in both its database sense (data structure for faster queries) and its book sense (pointing to information), creating humor through the double meaning."

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? Because they always show their EXPLAIN PLAN before executing."
  explanation: "This joke compares the SQL EXPLAIN command (which reveals query execution strategy) to showing your cards in poker, creating humor through the incongruity of applying database behavior to gambling."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a NoSQL bar. The bartender says 'Sorry, we don't serve your TYPE here.' The query responds, 'That's okay, I'm flexible with my SCHEMA anyway.'"
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke contrasting SQL's rigid schema requirements with NoSQL's flexibility, using bar rejection as a metaphor for database paradigm differences while employing multiple technical puns."

- text: "My boss asked me to write a query that returns yesterday's data instantly. I told him that violates the laws of physics AND database indexing."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the unrealistic expectations managers sometimes have about query performance, comparing impossible technical demands to impossible physical demands for humorous effect."

- text: "What's a DBA's favorite horror movie? The one where someone runs UPDATE without WHERE and there's no backup. It's called 'The Rollback That Never Was.'"
  explanation: "A multi-layered joke creating a fictional horror movie title about the ultimate database nightmare - updating all records accidentally with no way to undo it, playing on every DBA's worst fear."

- text: "I asked my database why it was so slow. It said, 'I'm not slow, I'm just doing a full table scan to make sure I don't miss anything.' That's when I knew we needed to have the indexing talk."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphized joke presents the database as overly thorough but inefficient, like a perfectionist who doesn't know better strategies, setting up the need for 'the talk' about proper indexing like a parent-child conversation."

- text: "A DBA dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'Welcome! Your eternal query is ready.' The DBA asks, 'What's the execution time?' St. Peter replies, 'Eternity.' The DBA says, 'So... same as my production queries then?' St. Peter checks his notes and says, 'Actually, you're right. We're sending you back - you're clearly already in hell.'"
  explanation: "A elaborate narrative joke that builds layers of humor: first suggesting heaven has queries, then revealing they take forever, then the twist that slow queries are already hellish, and finally the meta-twist that the DBA's current reality is indistinguishable from punishment, creating a darkly humorous commentary on production database performance issues."
