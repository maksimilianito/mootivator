- text: "Python developers say their language is the best. JavaScript developers say theirs is the best. C++ developers say nothing—they're still compiling."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory and misdirection pattern. It sets up a comparison between language advocates, then subverts expectations by referencing C++'s notoriously long compilation times rather than continuing the argument pattern."

- text: "Why do Rust developers never get lost? Because the compiler tells them exactly where they went wrong."
  explanation: "This plays on Rust's famously strict and helpful compiler error messages, using the double meaning of 'lost' (both directionally and in code) to create incongruity between real-world navigation and programming."

- text: "A Java developer walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'We don't serve your type here.' The developer replies, 'That's fine, I brought my own AbstractBeverageFactoryBean.'"
  explanation: "This joke mocks Java's verbose naming conventions and over-engineering tendencies, using the setup-punchline structure where the punchline reveals the stereotypical Java approach to simple problems."

- text: "PHP is like that friend who keeps showing up to parties even though everyone said they'd outgrown them years ago."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor and superiority theory to reference the ongoing 'PHP is dead' debate, while acknowledging PHP's continued widespread use despite predictions of its demise."

- text: "How do you know someone writes in Go? Don't worry, they'll tell you about their goroutines."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'How do you know someone is X?' joke format, playing on Go developers' enthusiasm for the language's concurrency features, similar to crossfit or vegan jokes."

- text: "JavaScript: the only language where you can add two arrays and get 'NaN' but everyone still calls it 'flexible.'"
  explanation: "This highlights JavaScript's type coercion quirks using incongruity theory—the disconnect between problematic behavior and the positive spin put on it by advocates."

- text: "C programmers don't die, they just get deallocated. C++ programmers don't die either—they throw an exception and never get caught."
  explanation: "This uses parallel structure and technical wordplay, contrasting manual memory management in C with C++'s exception handling, while playing on the phrase 'pass away.'"

- text: "Why did the Python developer break up with the C developer? Too many type issues."
  explanation: "Double meaning joke exploiting 'type' as both relationship compatibility and programming data types, contrasting Python's dynamic typing with C's static typing."

- text: "Ruby developers write beautiful code. Python developers write readable code. Perl developers write code."
  explanation: "This uses the rule of three with descending expectations, playing on Perl's reputation for write-only code while acknowledging Ruby's elegance and Python's readability focus."

- text: "In a bar, languages are arguing. Assembly says, 'I'm closest to the machine!' JavaScript says, 'I run everywhere!' Python says, 'I'm easiest to learn!' Brainfuck sits quietly in the corner, and everyone agrees not to make eye contact."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke personifies programming languages and uses Brainfuck as the punchline—a language so deliberately obtuse it wins the argument by making everyone uncomfortable."

- text: "Scala was invented when someone looked at Java and said, 'What if we made this more academic?' Then they looked at Haskell and said, 'What if we made this more practical?' The result confused everyone equally."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory to describe Scala's position between functional and object-oriented paradigms, suggesting it inherited the complexity of both worlds."

- text: "TypeScript is just JavaScript wearing a monocle and pretending it went to private school."
  explanation: "This uses vivid metaphor and class imagery to describe TypeScript's relationship to JavaScript, suggesting it's the same thing with pretensions of sophistication."

- text: "A C# developer and a Java developer walk into a bar. They spend three hours arguing about which copied which. The bartender, a C++ developer, says, 'You're both my children, and you both disappoint me.'"
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke references the historical relationship between these languages, using family dynamics as a metaphor while acknowledging C++ as their common ancestor."

- text: "Haskell: where you spend three weeks learning monads just to print 'Hello, World!' and then feel intellectually superior for the rest of your life."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration and superiority theory to mock both Haskell's steep learning curve and the stereotype of Haskell developers' elitism, while acknowledging the genuine difficulty."

- text: "Why don't programming languages ever get along? Because they all have different paradigms, but the real reason is that their developers won't shut up about them."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection—starting with a technical explanation (paradigms) then revealing the real joke is about developer tribalism rather than technical differences."

- text: "Rust developers: 'Our language prevents memory leaks!' C developers: 'Our language builds everything!' JavaScript developers: 'Our language runs on browsers!' COBOL developers, counting their pension: 'Our language runs banks.'"
  explanation: "This uses the rule of four with ascending punchlines, ending with COBOL as the unexpected winner by virtue of legacy system dominance and high contractor rates."

- text: "If programming languages were cars: C would be a manual transmission race car. Python would be a Tesla on autopilot. JavaScript would be a transformer that sometimes turns into a boat. And PHP would be that '95 Honda Civic that somehow still runs despite everyone's predictions."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor uses vivid imagery to capture each language's characteristics—C's power and complexity, Python's automation, JavaScript's flexibility/chaos, and PHP's surprising resilience."

- text: "A Python developer, a JavaScript developer, and a C++ developer are stranded on an island. The Python developer says, 'I'll import a rescue boat.' The JavaScript developer says, 'I'll callback for help.' The C++ developer is already building a boat but won't finish before the others die of old age."
  explanation: "This absurdist survival scenario uses each language's characteristics as personality traits—Python's library ecosystem, JavaScript's async nature, and C++'s complexity leading to over-engineering."

- text: "Functional programming advocates: 'No side effects! Pure functions! Immutability!' Object-oriented advocates: 'Encapsulation! Inheritance! Polymorphism!' Procedural programmers: *still shipping features while others argue*"
  explanation: "This joke uses contrast and misdirection to suggest that paradigm wars are ultimately less important than practical results, with the quiet procedural programmer winning by actually working."

- text: "The four stages of learning Rust: 1) This is impossible. 2) This is stupid. 3) Wait, the borrow checker is actually helping me. 4) *Rewriting everything in Rust while explaining memory safety to strangers*"
  explanation: "This progression joke captures the genuine learning curve and eventual zealotry of Rust adoption, using the four-stage pattern to show transformation from frustration to evangelism."

- text: "You know what's funny about the programming language wars? We're all just arguing about which tool is best for writing bugs. The real winner is the QA team, watching us fight while they collect evidence."
  explanation: "This meta-humor joke steps back from the wars entirely, using irony to suggest that despite all our arguments about language superiority, we all produce bugs equally, making the whole debate somewhat absurd from an outside perspective."
