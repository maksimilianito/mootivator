- text: "My code works perfectly. I just don't know why."
  explanation: This joke plays on the common developer experience of fixing bugs through trial and error without fully understanding the root cause. The incongruity lies in claiming perfection while admitting ignorance, highlighting the sometimes mysterious nature of debugging.
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer's bug report get ignored? It was marked as 'works on my machine.'"
  explanation: This uses the infamous phrase that frustrates QA teams everywhere. The humor comes from the superiority theory - we laugh at the developer's unhelpful response while recognizing we've all been guilty of it.

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd."
  explanation: This joke exemplifies incongruity theory by applying software testing edge cases to a real-world scenario. The escalating absurdity mimics actual test case thinking, making it relatable to anyone who's written comprehensive tests.
  rating: 9

- text: "The bug wasn't in my code. It was in the universe's implementation of physics."
  explanation: This employs misdirection and exaggeration, deflecting blame to the highest possible level. It satirizes developers' tendency to externalize problems while cleverly treating reality itself as buggy software.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't bugs ever take vacations? They're always in production."
  explanation: A double meaning joke playing on 'production' as both the production environment in software and the concept of being productive/active. The wordplay creates the humor through linguistic incongruity.
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours debugging. The problem was a missing semicolon. I'm not crying, you're crying."
  explanation: This captures the relief theory perfectly - releasing the tension of a frustrating debugging session. The emotional vulnerability combined with the trivial solution creates relatable humor about disproportionate effort.

- text: "How many programmers does it take to fix a bug? None, it's a hardware problem."
  explanation: This joke uses deflection and the classic light bulb joke structure. The humor comes from programmers' stereotypical tendency to blame other departments, highlighting interdepartmental dynamics in tech.
  rating: 5

- text: "My code has no bugs. It just develops random features."
  explanation: A classic reframing joke that turns the negative (bugs) into a positive (features). This plays on the corporate tendency to spin problems as opportunities, creating cynical but affectionate humor.

- text: "Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't Node how to Express himself."
  explanation: This uses technical wordplay with Node.js and Express.js framework names. The double meaning works on both emotional and technical levels, requiring programming knowledge to fully appreciate.

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: Parodying the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme while describing the worst possible practice. The humor comes from the confident admission of terrible methodology, using irony to highlight common bad practices.

- text: "A programmer's spouse says: 'While you're at the store, get milk.' The programmer never returns."
  explanation: This is a clever infinite loop joke using the ambiguity of 'while' as both a temporal conjunction and a programming control structure. The logical interpretation of the instruction creates an impossible situation.
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the bug go to therapy? It had unresolved issues."
  explanation: A simple pun playing on 'issues' as both psychological problems and software bug reports. The anthropomorphization of bugs makes technical frustration more approachable through relatable human experiences.
  rating: 5

- text: "99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, patch it around, 127 bugs in the code."
  explanation: This parodies the '99 Bottles of Beer' song while illustrating the hydra-like nature of bug fixing. The increasing number despite fixing one captures every developer's nightmare scenario with mathematical absurdity.
  rating: 9

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It has undocumented features that require specific environmental conditions, precise timing, and a full moon."
  explanation: This escalates the 'feature not bug' defense to absurd levels. The increasingly ridiculous requirements satirize how we rationalize unpredictable behavior, using exaggeration for comedic effect.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer stay calm during the critical bug? He had try-catch blocks around his emotions."
  explanation: This applies programming error-handling concepts to human psychology. The metaphor works on multiple levels, suggesting developers think in code even about their emotional responses.
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally found the bug! It was between the keyboard and chair."
  explanation: The classic PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair) joke. This uses misdirection - we expect a technical solution but get a self-deprecating admission that the programmer was the problem all along.
  rating: 6

- text: "A programmer was found dead in the shower. Instructions said: Lather, Rinse, Repeat. Cause of death: infinite loop."
  explanation: This dark humor joke applies programming logic to everyday instructions with fatal consequences. The absurdity of taking 'repeat' literally highlights how programmers think in precise, literal terms.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't bugs ever win at poker? They always show their stack trace."
  explanation: A sophisticated double meaning using 'stack trace' as both a debugging tool and a poker metaphor for revealing one's hand. The technical accuracy combined with gambling imagery creates layered humor.
  rating: 7

- text: "Senior developer's definition of debugging: removing the console.log statements I added while debugging."
  explanation: This meta-joke about the debugging process itself reveals the common practice of debugging by print statements. The irony is that 'debugging' becomes cleaning up debugging artifacts, creating a recursive humor situation.
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote a bug so clever it convinced management it was the new product roadmap."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke combines multiple humor theories: the bug achieves sentience (absurdity), management is fooled (superiority), and a disaster becomes success (incongruity). It satirizes both buggy code and corporate decision-making.
  rating: 9

- text: "The best thing about a boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by one bit."
  explanation: This brilliant technical joke plays with binary logic, data types, and the infamous 'off by one' error. It works on multiple levels: minimizing mistakes, precise technical accuracy, and the philosophical nature of being 'wrong' in the smallest possible way.
