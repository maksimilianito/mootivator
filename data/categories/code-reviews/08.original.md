- text: "Code reviews: where 'looks good to me' means 'I didn't actually read it.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common abbreviation 'LGTM' in code reviews, highlighting the gap between what reviewers say and what they actually do. It uses simple observational humor about a widespread practice."

- text: "Why do developers fear code reviews? Because someone might actually read their comments."
  explanation: "This joke uses the question-answer format to reveal the irony that developers often write poor or sarcastic comments in code, assuming no one will read them carefully until a code review exposes everything."

- text: "My code review feedback was so detailed, the developer asked if I was writing their biography."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates the length and detail of code review comments, comparing them to a biographical work. It highlights the sometimes excessive nature of reviewer feedback."

- text: "Code reviews are like dental checkups: everyone knows they're necessary, but nobody enjoys them."
  explanation: "This analogy joke compares code reviews to an unpleasant but important activity, using a relatable everyday experience to highlight the love-hate relationship developers have with the review process."

- text: "I approve all code reviews on Fridays. It's called 'optimistic deployment.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the risky practice of approving code without thorough review before the weekend, combining workplace timing humor with the ironic term 'optimistic deployment' to mask carelessness."

- text: "The code review had more comments than the code had lines. We called it 'documentation by criticism.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration and wordplay, suggesting that excessive review comments become a form of documentation themselves, inverting the normal relationship between code and comments."

- text: "Why did the code review take three weeks? The reviewer was waiting for the perfect moment to say 'use const instead of let.'"
  explanation: "This joke mocks the phenomenon of reviewers nitpicking minor stylistic issues while ignoring more substantial problems, and the delay suggests they're overthinking trivial feedback."

- text: "My teammate's code review style: approve everything, fix everything later when they're blamed for the bugs."
  explanation: "This joke reveals a cynical but realistic strategy some developers use to avoid conflict during reviews, only to end up doing more work later. It's dark humor about workplace dynamics."

- text: "In code reviews, 'interesting approach' is developer-speak for 'what were you thinking?'"
  explanation: "This joke decodes the polite euphemisms developers use in code reviews to avoid direct criticism, showing the gap between diplomatic language and actual thoughts."

- text: "Our code review process has four stages: denial, anger, bargaining, and eventual approval."
  explanation: "This joke cleverly adapts the five stages of grief (removing depression) to describe the emotional journey developers experience when receiving critical feedback, using pattern recognition humor."

- text: "Why don't developers like code reviews? Because 'self-merge' isn't an approved workflow."
  explanation: "This joke highlights developers' desire to skip the review process entirely by merging their own code, playing on the tension between autonomy and quality control."

- text: "I wrote 'please review' on my pull request. Three months later, it's still gathering dust like a museum artifact."
  explanation: "This joke uses metaphor and exaggeration to describe the common frustration of pull requests being ignored, comparing forgotten code to ancient artifacts."

- text: "Code review feedback: 'This will work, but future you will hate present you.' Narrator: Future me did indeed hate present me."
  explanation: "This joke uses the narrator device to create dramatic irony, showing the accuracy of reviewer predictions about technical debt and the developer's regret for ignoring good advice."

- text: "My code reviewer suggested 47 changes. I made 46 of them. The 47th was 'consider a career change.'"
  explanation: "This joke builds up with a reasonable number of changes before delivering an absurd punchline that crosses from technical feedback into personal attack, creating humor through escalation."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with their code reviewer? Too many commitment issues with their pull requests."
  explanation: "This joke uses romantic relationship terminology ('break up,' 'commitment issues') applied to the technical concept of committing code, creating humor through domain mixing."

- text: "Code reviews would be faster if we admitted that 'let me think about this' means 'I have no idea what this code does.'"
  explanation: "This joke exposes the face-saving language reviewers use when they don't understand code, revealing the gap between professional appearance and actual comprehension."

- text: "Our code review process is very democratic: everyone gets to comment, but only the senior developer's opinion counts."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony to highlight the false democracy of code reviews, where hierarchy ultimately determines outcomes despite the appearance of collaborative decision-making."

- text: "I asked for constructive feedback on my code. I got a link to 'Programming for Dummies' and a hug emoji."
  explanation: "This joke combines insult with mock sympathy, showing how 'constructive' feedback can be passive-aggressive. The juxtaposition of harsh implication and gentle emoji creates absurdist humor."

- text: "Why did the code review turn into a philosophy debate? Because someone wrote 'any questions?' and the reviewer asked 'what is truth?'"
  explanation: "This joke escalates a simple code review into absurdist territory by having a reviewer respond to a routine question with deep philosophical inquiry, mocking over-analytical reviewers."

- text: "My code review comment was so long it had chapters, footnotes, and a bibliography. The developer responded with 'k.'"
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through extreme contrast between the reviewer's exhaustive effort and the developer's minimal response, highlighting the sometimes futile nature of detailed feedback."

- text: "Code reviews are just developers playing 'spot the difference' with your code and their ego."
  explanation: "This joke reframes code reviews as a children's game while simultaneously suggesting that reviewer feedback is often driven by ego rather than genuine quality concerns, combining multiple layers of cynical observation into a sharp aphorism."
