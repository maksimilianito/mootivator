- text: My RAM stick went to therapy. It had too many issues to address.
  explanation: A simple pun playing on "address" as both a psychological term (dealing with problems) and a technical term (memory addresses in RAM). The double meaning creates the humor through wordplay.

- text: Why did the hard drive go to school? It wanted to get more storage space!
  explanation: This joke uses the incongruity of applying human educational goals to hardware. "Storage space" works both as physical school storage and digital data storage, creating a playful connection between education and hardware capacity.
  rating: 4

- text: My CPU is so old, it remembers when megahertz was considered fast.
  explanation: A nostalgia-based joke that personifies the CPU and plays on the rapid evolution of processor speeds, from megahertz to gigahertz. The humor comes from the relatability of outdated technology.
  rating: 5

- text: The motherboard filed for divorce. She couldn't handle all the peripheral relationships anymore.
  explanation: This joke anthropomorphizes computer components, using "peripheral relationships" as a double meaning - both computer peripherals connected to the motherboard and complicated human relationships, creating humor through unexpected application of relationship terminology to hardware.
  rating: 7

- text: I told my graphics card a joke, but it couldn't render the humor.
  explanation: Playing on "render" as both understanding/interpreting humor and the technical process of graphics rendering. The incongruity of expecting a GPU to understand jokes creates the comedic effect.

- text: Why don't processors ever win at poker? Because they always show their cache!
  explanation: A pun combining poker terminology ("show your cards") with CPU cache memory. The joke works on the double meaning of "cache" sounding like "cash" and being a technical component, while also playing on the poker metaphor.
  rating: 8

- text: My SSD is so fast, it loads before I even click.
  explanation: An exaggeration joke that plays on the speed difference between SSDs and older hard drives. The absurdity of something happening before the action that causes it creates humor through impossible temporal logic.

- text: The power supply walked into a bar. The bartender said, "We don't serve your type here." It replied, "That's fine, I'm AC/DC anyway."
  explanation: A multi-layered joke referencing both AC/DC power types and the rock band, while also playing on discrimination themes in classic bar jokes. The technical accuracy combined with wordplay creates sophisticated humor.
  rating: 9

- text: Why did the RAM module break up with the hard drive? She said he was too slow to commit anything to long-term memory.
  explanation: This joke uses relationship metaphors to explain the technical difference between volatile RAM and persistent storage, with "commit" being both a relationship term and a technical operation, while "long-term memory" works on both psychological and storage levels.
  rating: 8

- text: I asked my computer for a byte. It gave me eight bits of attitude.
  explanation: A concise technical pun on the fact that a byte equals eight bits, while "bits of attitude" plays on the colloquial expression. The personification of the computer adds to the humor.
  rating: 7

- text: The CPU and GPU got into an argument. The CPU said, "I'm the brain of the operation!" The GPU replied, "Yeah, but I'm the one with thousands of cores and still no one calls me 'intelligent.'"
  explanation: This joke highlights the irony that GPUs have many more cores than CPUs but aren't considered the "smart" component. It plays on the parallel processing vs. sequential processing debate while creating humor through the GPU's self-aware complaint.
  rating: 8

- text: My cooling fan is a philosopher. It's always asking, "What's the thermal meaning of life?"
  explanation: A pun combining existential philosophy ("meaning of life") with thermal management in computers. The absurdity of a fan being philosophical, combined with the technical wordplay on "thermal," creates layered humor.
  rating: 6

- text: Why did the mechanical keyboard go to the doctor? It had a case of repetitive stress syndrome - from all the gamers mashing its keys!
  explanation: This joke plays on both the human condition of repetitive stress injury and the physical abuse gaming keyboards endure. The reversal of concern (the keyboard as patient instead of user) creates the comedic twist.
  rating: 5

- text: The BIOS went to a party but left early. It said it just needed to POST and go.
  explanation: A sophisticated technical pun on POST (Power-On Self-Test) that the BIOS performs, combined with the social media meaning of "post and go." The joke requires knowledge of boot processes, making it humor for the technically informed.
  rating: 8

- text: I tried to explain Moore's Law to my old processor. It didn't have the capacity to understand exponential growth - or much of anything anymore.
  explanation: Self-referential irony where an old processor can't understand the law that explains why it's obsolete. The joke works on multiple levels: the technical concept, the meta-commentary, and the sad reality of hardware obsolescence.
  rating: 7

- text: Why don't USB drives ever win arguments? Because no matter how right they are, you always have to flip them three times before anyone accepts their point.
  explanation: This joke references the infamous USB superposition problem - the phenomenon where USB-A connectors seem to need three attempts to plug in correctly. The metaphor of "accepting their point" works both physically and argumentatively.
  rating: 9

- text: My RGB lighting has an existential crisis every night. It keeps asking, "Am I truly necessary, or am I just here to look pretty and drain power?"
  explanation: A self-aware joke about the controversial nature of RGB lighting in gaming hardware. The existential crisis format elevates a practical criticism into philosophical humor, while accurately capturing the community debate about form vs. function.
  rating: 8

- text: The heat sink and thermal paste are in couples therapy. The counselor asked, "What's the problem?" Heat sink replied, "She's too clingy." Thermal paste sobbed, "That's literally my job!"
  explanation: This joke brilliantly uses relationship therapy to explain the actual function of thermal paste (creating maximum contact between CPU and heat sink). The humor comes from thermal paste's defensive response being both emotionally valid and technically accurate.
  rating: 9

- text: Why did the quantum computer refuse to tell jokes? Because until you measured the audience's reaction, the joke was simultaneously funny and not funny, and that kind of pressure was just too much.
  explanation: A sophisticated joke that requires understanding of quantum superposition and Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox, applied to the uncertainty of joke-telling. The meta-humor of a quantum computer being anxious about quantum uncertainty creates multiple layers of comedy.
  rating: 9

- text: My overclocked CPU started a self-help group called "Living Life at 5.2 GHz." Their motto? "We may burn out faster, but at least we'll process our trauma efficiently before we do."
  explanation: Dark humor that perfectly captures overclocking culture - pushing hardware beyond safe limits for performance. The joke combines technical accuracy (actual overclock speeds), existential awareness (burnout), and the irony of "processing trauma" using computing terminology.

- text: A photon checks into a hotel. The bellhop asks, "Any luggage?" The photon replies, "No, I'm traveling light." Meanwhile, an electron checks in and demands a room change three times because it can't decide which orbital to occupy. The frustrated manager mutters, "At least the photon had momentum."
  explanation: This is peak hardware humor combining physics, quantum mechanics, and wordplay. "Traveling light" works literally (photon properties) and colloquially. The electron's indecisiveness references quantum orbital uncertainty, while "momentum" is both a physics term and colloquial expression. It's a masterclass in multi-layered technical comedy that rewards deeper knowledge.
