- text: "What's the difference between a database and a teenager? One ignores foreign keys, the other ignores foreign languages."
  explanation: "Comparative joke using parallel structure, playing on 'foreign keys' (database constraints) and 'foreign languages' (human learning), suggesting both have selective attention problems."
  rating: 6

- text: "My database said it needed space. I gave it more storage, but apparently it wanted a different kind of relationship."
  explanation: "Multi-layered joke where 'space' means disk storage technically but emotional distance romantically, and 'relationship' refers to both personal connections and database table relationships."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks, 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"

- text: "Why did the database break up with the spreadsheet? Too many Excel-lent excuses but no real commitment to normalization."
  explanation: "Complex wordplay on 'Excel' (Microsoft software) and 'excellent,' while referencing database normalization principles that spreadsheets ignore, suggesting a relationship doomed by fundamental incompatibility."
