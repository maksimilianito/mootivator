- text: "P = NP? More like P = 'Not Productive'."
  explanation: "A play on the famous unsolved problem in computer science (P versus NP) where the joke substitutes the technical meaning with a relatable programmer experience of procrastination. Uses wordplay on the abbreviation 'NP' to create an unexpected meaning."

- text: "Why did the algorithm go to therapy? It had unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "Classic setup-punchline structure that applies a technical concept (dependencies in software) to a human psychological context (therapy). The incongruity between computational and emotional 'issues' creates the humor."

- text: "My sorting algorithm is so slow, it's practically a philosophy degree."
  explanation: "Combines the concept of algorithmic efficiency with a stereotype about philosophy degrees taking a long time. Creates humor through exaggeration and unexpected comparison between technical and academic domains."

- text: "I tried to explain Big O notation to my date. It didn't go well—apparently 'you're O(1) in my heart' isn't romantic."
  explanation: "Attempts to use computer science notation (constant time complexity) as a romantic compliment, failing because of the mismatch between technical precision and emotional expression. The humor comes from the social awkwardness of over-applying technical thinking."

- text: "Recursion: see 'Recursion'."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that demonstrates recursion by referencing itself, mimicking the style of dictionary definitions. The humor is in the self-referential nature and the absurdity of an infinitely circular definition."

- text: "Why don't theoretical computer scientists ever get lost? Because they can always find a path in polynomial time—even if it's exponentially far."
  explanation: "Plays on the contradiction between finding a solution quickly (polynomial time) and the actual distance being impractically large (exponential). Highlights the gap between theoretical possibility and practical utility in complexity theory."

- text: "I wrote a proof that P = NP, but the margin is too small to contain it. Also, it's wrong."
  explanation: "References Fermat's famous marginal note while adding a self-deprecating twist. The humor comes from building up expectation of a breakthrough discovery, then immediately deflating it with honesty about its incorrectness."

- text: "My Turing machine keeps rejecting me. I think I'm not in its language."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes a Turing machine's formal language acceptance mechanism as romantic rejection. Creates humor by applying the technical concept of language membership to personal relationships."

- text: "Why did the computer scientist break up with automata theory? Too many states, not enough transitions."
  explanation: "Uses the technical components of finite state machines (states and transitions) as a metaphor for a stagnant relationship. The joke works on both technical and relational levels."

- text: "I'm not procrastinating, I'm just running a Monte Carlo simulation of all possible ways I could start working."
  explanation: "Justifies procrastination using a legitimate algorithmic approach (Monte Carlo methods). The humor lies in the absurd over-application of probabilistic algorithms to simple decision-making."

- text: "Quantum computing is easy: you just need to be in two places at once—denial and confusion."
  explanation: "Plays on quantum superposition while describing the common experience of learning quantum computing. The parallel structure between quantum states and emotional states creates the humor."

- text: "Why was the halting problem invited to every party? Because no one could prove it wouldn't show up."
  explanation: "Clever application of the undecidability of the halting problem to social situations. The joke works because the logical impossibility of proving non-attendance mirrors the mathematical impossibility of solving the halting problem."

- text: "I optimized my algorithm from O(n²) to O(n log n). My manager asked why it took two weeks. I said I had to reduce it logarithmically."
  explanation: "Creates humor through the absurd literal interpretation of 'logarithmically' as describing the work pace rather than the complexity improvement. Highlights the disconnect between technical achievement and management understanding."

- text: "My love life is NP-complete: I can verify a good match when I see one, but finding one is computationally intractable."
  explanation: "Perfectly applies the definition of NP-completeness (easy to verify, hard to find solutions) to dating. The technical accuracy combined with relatable frustration makes this effective."

- text: "Why do graph theorists make terrible friends? They're always looking for the shortest path to exit the conversation."
  explanation: "Takes the graph theory concept of shortest path algorithms and applies it to social awkwardness. The humor comes from the anti-social implication of constantly seeking to minimize interaction time."

- text: "I told my professor I found a polynomial-time solution to an NP-complete problem. He said 'Publish or perish.' I said 'Debug or die.'"
  explanation: "Plays with the academic phrase 'publish or perish' by creating a parallel programmer version. The joke acknowledges the likely presence of bugs in such an extraordinary claim while maintaining structural symmetry."

- text: "Complexity theory in relationships: Finding someone is O(n), keeping them is O(n!), and explaining why you're single is O(1)—it's constant."
  explanation: "Uses three different complexity classes to describe relationship stages, with escalating difficulty. The punchline about being single being constant-time is self-deprecating and builds on the progression."

- text: "Why did the lambda calculus practitioner refuse to commit? Because they believed in beta reduction, not relationship reduction."
  explanation: "Wordplay on 'reduction' in lambda calculus versus reducing/ending relationships. Works on multiple levels as beta reduction is about simplification, opposite of commitment complexity."

- text: "I proved that my dissertation is undecidable. My advisor was not amused. Apparently 'Gödel says I can't finish' isn't a valid defense."
  explanation: "Applies Gödel's incompleteness theorem and undecidability to academic procrastination. The humor comes from trying to use profound mathematical limitations as an excuse for not completing work."

- text: "My therapist asked about my childhood. I said it was O(log n)—I only remember half of each previous year. She wrote 'understands recursion' in her notes."
  explanation: "Brilliantly combines logarithmic complexity with the recursive nature of binary search and memory. The therapist's misunderstanding adds another layer, as she interprets technical thinking as psychological insight."

- text: "Why do automata theorists never finish their drinks? Because every state is potentially a final state, so they keep pausing to check if they're done, creating an infinite loop of indecision that only halts when someone proves their drinking pattern is undecidable."
  explanation: "This joke layers multiple concepts: final states in automata, the halting problem, and infinite loops. The escalating complexity of the explanation mirrors the over-analytical nature of theoretical computer scientists, making the joke self-demonstrating. The absurdity of applying formal verification to drinking creates rich incongruity."
