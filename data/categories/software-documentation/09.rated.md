- text: "A programmer's guide to documentation: Step 1: Write 'See code for details.' Step 2: There is no Step 2."
  explanation: This instructional-format joke satirizes lazy documentation practices by making the anti-documentation approach itself a documented process.

- text: "What's a developer's favorite fairy tale? The one where documentation writes itself and stays updated forever. They call it 'fantasy.'"
  explanation: This joke uses the fairy tale framework to emphasize how unrealistic automatic documentation is, with the punchline explicitly categorizing it as fantasy.

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to explain my undocumented code. It said, 'I'm an AI, not a miracle worker.'"
  explanation: A contemporary joke that brings in modern AI tools, using misdirection to suggest that even advanced AI can't help with truly undocumented code.

- text: "A developer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'You can enter if you can explain this code.' The developer looks at it and says, 'But I wrote this! Where's my documentation?' St. Peter replies, 'Exactly. Welcome to hell.'"
  explanation: This elaborate story uses religious imagery and a twist ending to deliver the ultimate punishment: being confronted with your own undocumented code for eternity.

- text: "Documentation is the art of explaining yesterday's decisions to tomorrow's confused developer, except nobody's writing it because they're too busy being today's confused developer."
  explanation: This philosophical joke uses temporal paradox and circular logic to capture the perpetual cycle of confusion caused by lack of documentation, with layered humor about how everyone is both victim and perpetrator.

- text: "They say good documentation is like good comedy: timing is everything. That's why my documentation is like my standup careerâ€”it doesn't exist, but I keep telling myself I'll start tomorrow. Meanwhile, my code is out there performing to confused audiences every day, bombing without a script, getting heckled in the comments, and somehow still running in production. The show must go on, even if nobody knows what show it is."
  explanation: This extended metaphor brilliantly compares documentation to comedy performance, using multiple layers of humor including self-deprecation, procrastination culture, and the absurdity of production code without documentation. The joke builds momentum through the comedy metaphor, creating vivid imagery of code as a performer without direction, which resonates with the chaos of undocumented systems while maintaining the entertainment industry parallel throughout.
