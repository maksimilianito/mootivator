- text: "I tried to revert my commit, but my code just kept getting worse. Turns out I was using 'git regret' instead of 'git revert'."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common typo and emotional state of developers when they need to undo changes. The wordplay between 'revert' and 'regret' captures the feeling of making mistakes in version control."

- text: "Why did the developer always commit on Friday afternoons? He liked living dangerously."
  explanation: "This joke references the infamous practice of deploying or committing code right before the weekend, which is considered risky because if something breaks, you might have to work through the weekend to fix it."

- text: "My Git repository is like my closet—full of branches I'll never merge and old commits I'm too afraid to delete."
  explanation: "This joke uses the relatable metaphor of a messy closet to describe the common problem of accumulated technical debt in version control systems, with abandoned feature branches and historical commits."

- text: "What's a version control system's favorite dance? The merge conflict shuffle."
  explanation: "This plays on the frustrating experience of dealing with merge conflicts, likening the back-and-forth process of resolving them to an awkward dance."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. #YOLO #NoVersionControl"
  explanation: "This joke satirizes the dangerous practice of not using version control and testing directly in production environments, referencing the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format."

- text: "SVN user walks into a bar. Bartender says, 'Sorry, we only serve distributed systems here.' The SVN user is still waiting for permission to leave."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the fundamental difference between centralized version control (SVN) and distributed systems (Git), poking fun at SVN's requirement for server communication for most operations."

- text: "Why don't Git users ever get lost? Because they always know where their HEAD is."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'HEAD' (both the Git pointer to the current commit and the colloquial term for one's mind) to create a pun about Git's internal structure."

- text: "My commit messages are like my diary entries: 'fixed stuff,' 'more fixes,' 'why doesn't this work,' 'FINALLY WORKS.'"
  explanation: "This joke reflects the common practice of writing vague, unhelpful commit messages and captures the emotional journey of debugging through the progression of messages."

- text: "I told my junior developer to create a new branch. Three hours later, I found him in the garden with pruning shears."
  explanation: "This uses the literal interpretation of 'branch' to create a misunderstanding joke, playing on the gap between technical terminology and everyday language."

- text: "What did the Git commit say to its parent? 'Thanks for everything, but I'm going to rebase my entire existence.'"
  explanation: "This joke personifies Git commits and uses 'rebase' (which rewrites commit history) as a metaphor for rejecting one's origins, similar to a rebellious teenager."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SVN? Because Git had better commitment issues resolution."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'commitment' (romantic relationships and version control commits) while also referencing Git's superior merge conflict handling."

- text: "I tried to explain Git to my grandmother. Now she thinks I'm in a cult that worships trees and cherries."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Git's terminology (tree structures, cherry-picking) which sounds bizarre when taken out of technical context, highlighting how alien programming concepts can seem to non-technical people."

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks, 'Why do you talk about your ex so much?' The programmer replies, 'That's not my ex, that's my main branch. Though honestly, the relationship is similar—stable but boring.'"
  explanation: "This joke creates a parallel between romantic relationships and Git branches, with 'main' being the stable, production-ready branch that lacks the excitement of feature branches."

- text: "What's the difference between a Git user and a time traveler? The Git user actually keeps documentation of what they changed in the past."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the concept of version control as a time machine for code, while humorously suggesting that even time travelers wouldn't be as diligent about documenting their changes."

- text: "I ran 'git blame' to find who wrote the bad code. It was me. From yesterday. I'm now in a passive-aggressive argument with myself in the commit comments."
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'git blame' command (which shows who last modified each line) to create a humorous scenario of self-confrontation, a common experience for developers reviewing their own old code."

- text: "Why did the Git repository go to therapy? It had too many unresolved conflicts and its parents kept getting detached."
  explanation: "This joke uses multiple Git concepts (merge conflicts, parent commits, detached HEAD state) as metaphors for psychological issues, creating layers of technical wordplay."

- text: "A Git user, an SVN user, and a developer with no version control walk into a bar. The Git user forks the conversation, the SVN user waits for permission to speak, and the other guy just rewrites history claiming he was never there."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts three approaches to version control through their behaviors, with Git's distributed nature (forking), SVN's centralized permissions, and the chaos of no version control at all."

- text: "My code review process: 'git commit -m \"fixed typo\"' followed by 47 more commits that say 'actually fixed typo' because I keep finding new ones every time I push."
  explanation: "This joke captures the common experience of making multiple small commits for what should have been one change, highlighting the iterative nature of development and our inability to catch all mistakes at once."

- text: "What's a Git user's favorite philosophy? 'To commit or not to commit, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler to stash the changes or to push them straight to main and suffer the outrageous fortune of breaking production.'"
  explanation: "This joke parodies Shakespeare's famous Hamlet soliloquy, replacing existential questions with version control dilemmas, elevating the mundane decision of when to commit to philosophical importance."

- text: "I asked Git to show me the meaning of life. It returned 'fatal: ambiguous argument 'meaning': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.' Turns out even Git doesn't have all the answers—but at least it keeps track of all my mistakes."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes Git as a philosophical advisor, using its actual error message format to deliver existential humor while acknowledging version control's true purpose: documenting our failures."

- text: "Three developers are arguing about the best version control system. The Git user says, 'Mine is distributed and fast!' The SVN user says, 'Mine is simple and centralized!' The developer with no version control shouts, 'MINE WORKS UNTIL MY HARD DRIVE CRASHES!' They all pause. Then the Git user whispers, 'That's not version control, that's version roulette.' The SVN user adds, 'More like version control-alt-delete.' The third developer is no longer in the conversation—his computer just crashed."
  explanation: "This extended joke builds tension through a three-way comparison, uses multiple technical puns (control-alt-delete), and delivers a dark comedy punchline where the consequences of not using version control manifest in real-time, validating the other developers' positions through catastrophic demonstration."
