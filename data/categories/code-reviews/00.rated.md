- text: "Code reviews: where we pretend we're checking for bugs but we're really checking for semicolons."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the incongruity between the stated purpose of code reviews (finding logical errors) and what reviewers often focus on (minor formatting issues). It's a gentle observation about how reviews sometimes prioritize style over substance."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the code review take so long? The reviewer was still loading."
  explanation: "This uses computer terminology ('loading') applied to human behavior, creating humor through the misdirection of treating a person like a slow computer process. It comments on reviewers who take excessive time to respond."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code review came back with 'LGTM' - Looks Good, Try Merging."
  explanation: "This redefines the common acronym 'LGTM' (Looks Good To Me) to suggest the reviewer didn't actually test the code, just approved it. It's a play on the double meaning pattern and comments on superficial reviews."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code reviews are like going to the dentist - you know it's good for you, but you still dread the appointment."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory through self-deprecating humor, comparing the anxiety of having your work scrutinized to an unpleasant but necessary medical procedure. The analogy creates relatability."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't developers like code reviews? Because every 'suggestion' is really a 'you should have known better.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the incongruity between the gentle language of 'suggestions' and the implied criticism, revealing the social dynamics and ego challenges inherent in peer review processes."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked for a code review. I got a philosophical debate about variable naming conventions instead."
  explanation: "This uses the misdirection pattern - expecting technical feedback about logic but receiving endless bikeshedding about trivial matters. It's a common frustration in the review process."
  rating: 7

- text: "Code reviewer's motto: 'I don't always find bugs, but when I do, they're in lines I didn't even look at.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format while highlighting the paradox of how bugs are often found accidentally, not through systematic review, creating humor through self-aware irony."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the junior developer cry during code review? Because they used 'var' instead of 'let' and got a 10-paragraph essay on JavaScript history."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the disproportionate response to minor issues, using the superiority theory to mock overzealous reviewers who prioritize showing knowledge over being helpful."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code reviews: where 'Can we discuss this?' really means 'I will die on this hill.'"
  explanation: "This reveals the hidden meaning behind polite code review language, creating humor through the incongruity between the diplomatic phrasing and the actual stubbornness it masks."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code review feedback was just a link to Stack Overflow. At least they did the research for me."
  explanation: "This uses irony to comment on lazy reviewers who don't provide actual feedback, just point to external resources. The positive spin at the end adds an additional layer of humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the code review turn into a therapy session? Because every comment started with 'I feel like...'"
  explanation: "This mocks the trend of using emotional language in technical feedback, creating humor through the absurdity of treating code reviews like emotional support sessions rather than technical discussions."
  rating: 8

- text: "I submitted 5 lines of code for review. I got back 50 lines of comments. I'm not sure if I'm a developer or a discussion starter."
  explanation: "This uses numerical contrast to highlight the disproportionate response, with the punchline reframing the developer's role from coder to conversation catalyst, revealing the social aspect of reviews."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code reviews are like dating apps - everyone's looking for red flags, nobody's appreciating the effort."
  explanation: "This analogy creates humor by comparing the hyper-critical nature of code reviews to the judgmental nature of dating apps, highlighting how both focus on negatives rather than positives."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer automate their code reviews? Because humans kept having opinions."
  explanation: "This plays on the relief theory - the desire to escape subjective human judgment by using objective automated tools. The punchline treats 'opinions' as a bug rather than a feature."
  rating: 8

- text: "My favorite code review comment: 'This works, but I would have done it differently.' Thanks, that's super helpful for merging."
  explanation: "This uses sarcasm to highlight unhelpful feedback that expresses personal preference without actionable criticism. The incongruity between 'helpful' and the actual uselessness creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code reviews follow the Goldilocks principle: too fast means you didn't read it, too slow means you're rewriting it yourself, just right means you're on vacation."
  explanation: "This applies a fairy tale structure to code review timing, with the twist that the 'just right' scenario is actually the reviewer being absent. It's a complex joke with layered meanings about review quality."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the code review board become a democracy? Because 'Request Changes' needed a two-thirds majority to override 'I like it.'"
  explanation: "This applies political systems to code review processes, creating absurdity through the formalization of what should be technical decisions into bureaucratic procedures."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally got 'Approved' on my pull request! Wait, the reviewer just approved their own comment by mistake."
  explanation: "This creates humor through false hope followed by deflation, playing on the UI confusion in code review tools and the desperate desire for approval that developers experience."
  rating: 7

- text: "Code review feedback levels: 1) Typo corrections, 2) Style preferences, 3) Architecture suggestions, 4) Existential questions about why we're building this at all."
  explanation: "This creates a humorous escalation pattern that starts with trivial issues and ends with philosophical questioning, revealing how code reviews can spiral from technical to existential territory."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the senior developer write 'LGTM' on every review? Because they learned that 'Let's Get This Merged' is the secret to team happiness."
  explanation: "This redefines LGTM twice - first as the standard acronym, then as a pragmatic philosophy. It's meta-humor about the social dynamics of keeping teams productive versus being pedantic."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code review process: 1) Submit PR, 2) Wait for feedback, 3) Fix issues, 4) Repeat steps 2-3 until reviewer gets bored and approves, 5) Merge before they change their mind."
  explanation: "This is the most sophisticated joke, presenting a cynical but realistic flowchart that reveals the truth about code reviews - they often end not when the code is perfect, but when the reviewer's attention wanes. The final step adds urgency and comedy through the fear of renewed scrutiny. It combines multiple humor theories: incongruity (between ideal and reality), superiority (self-deprecating acknowledgment), and relief (expressing the shared frustration of endless revision cycles)."
