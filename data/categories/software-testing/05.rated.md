- text: "QA Engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd."
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure with escalating absurdity, illustrating how QA engineers test edge cases and invalid inputs. The humor comes from applying systematic testing methodology to a mundane social situation, creating incongruity between expected bar behavior and software testing practices."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't testers ever get lost? They always follow the test cases."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke using the double meaning pattern. 'Following test cases' refers both to executing test documentation and literally following directions, creating a mild incongruity that's accessible to non-technical audiences."
  rating: 4

- text: "A tester walks into a bar and asks, 'Is this seat taken, not taken, null, or undefined?'"
  explanation: "This joke applies programming logic to everyday situations, using the incongruity theory. The humor stems from over-analyzing a simple yes/no question with technical precision, reflecting how testers think about all possible states."
  rating: 7

- text: "Software testing is like a relationship: you find problems when you're looking for them, and also when you're not."
  explanation: "This uses the relief theory by acknowledging the frustrating reality of bug discovery. The comparison to relationships creates an unexpected connection between technical work and human experience, making it relatable."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code works perfectly. I tested it on my machine."
  explanation: "Classic self-deprecating humor using the superiority theory. The joke plays on the infamous 'works on my machine' excuse, highlighting the gap between local testing and production reality, which every developer has experienced."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the unit test go to therapy? It had too many dependencies."
  explanation: "This applies the question-answer format with technical terminology. 'Dependencies' works as both a programming concept and an emotional issue, creating a double meaning that resonates with developers who struggle with tightly coupled code."
  rating: 8

- text: "Found a bug. Fixed it. Created three new bugs. This is called 'job security.'"
  explanation: "Dark humor using the relief theory to cope with the frustrating reality of software development. The reframing of a negative situation as 'job security' provides both comedy and psychological comfort."
  rating: 8

- text: "Testers don't break your code. They just find where it's already broken and show you the pieces."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses misdirection by first suggesting testers are destructive, then reframing them as helpful. It addresses the tension between developers and QA while defending testers' role."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers hate testing their own code? Because they already know where all the bodies are buried."
  explanation: "This metaphorical joke uses dark humor to express how developers are often aware of their code's weaknesses but avoid confronting them. The 'buried bodies' metaphor creates vivid imagery."
  rating: 8

- text: "A QA engineer's favorite game is hide and seek. The bugs always win."
  explanation: "This personifies bugs as playful adversaries, using the incongruity of comparing serious software testing to children's games. The admission that 'bugs always win' reflects the endless nature of testing work."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of testing in production. The casual tone contrasts with the serious implications, creating humor through understatement."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the test fail? Because it was written to pass."
  explanation: "This philosophical joke plays with the paradox that tests written with knowledge of the implementation often miss real bugs. It uses the paradox method to highlight a genuine testing problem."
  rating: 7

- text: "Automated testing: where you spend three hours automating a five-minute test, then maintain it forever."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration and the relief theory to acknowledge the ironic time investment in automation. The truth behind the exaggeration makes it resonate with anyone who's implemented test automation."
  rating: 9

- text: "The difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation and confidence."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory to comment on how subjective software quality can be. It's a cynical observation that reflects real industry practices where bugs are sometimes rebranded as features."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't testers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including the bugs."
  explanation: "This combines a classic science joke format with testing culture. The double meaning of 'make up' (constitute vs. fabricate) creates wordplay that connects physics humor with software testing paranoia."
  rating: 5

- text: "My test coverage is 100%. Unfortunately, my code coverage is only 23%."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity between two related metrics to highlight how developers sometimes focus on the wrong things. The reversal of expected priorities creates the humor through absurdity."
  rating: 6

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This technical pun uses the double meaning of JOIN (social and SQL operation) to create humor. The personification of database concepts makes abstract technical ideas more relatable and memorable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the integration test take so long? It was waiting for all its dependencies to show up, and you know how microservices are about punctuality."
  explanation: "This joke personifies microservices as unreliable friends, using the incongruity theory to apply human social dynamics to distributed systems. The humor comes from the relatable frustration of dealing with service dependencies."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer, and the QA team is sending you anonymous tips."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor creates a vivid scenario that captures the relationship between developers and testers. The multi-layered comparison works on several levels, making it both funny and insightful about software development dynamics."
  rating: 10

- text: "A QA engineer, a developer, and a product manager walk into a bar. The QA engineer says, 'Before we sit down, I need to verify this bar exists, check if these seats are stable, confirm the menu is readable, test if the bartender responds to requests, and validate that the exit signs are properly lit.' The developer says, 'It worked fine when I was here last week.' The product manager says, 'Can we just skip to the part where we're having fun?'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic 'walks into a bar' format but extends it to capture three distinct professional personalities. The humor builds through contrasting approaches: the tester's thoroughness, the developer's anecdotal evidence, and the product manager's impatience with process. It's a story-format joke that resonates because it accurately reflects workplace dynamics."

- text: "The best thing about a boolean is that even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit. The worst thing about testing is that even if you're thorough, you're still missing edge cases. The beautiful thing is that the tester who finds your edge case will document it in such excruciating detail that you'll know exactly how wrong you were, down to the bit."
  explanation: "This three-part aphorism builds complexity through parallel structure, starting with a technical pun (bit/boolean), acknowledging testing's limitations, then delivering a punchline about tester thoroughness. It uses meta-humor by commenting on the relationship between precision in computing and precision in bug reporting, creating layers of meaning that reward technical knowledge."
