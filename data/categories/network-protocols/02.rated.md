- text: "TCP: At least I'll get there eventually."
  explanation: "This joke plays on TCP's reliable delivery guarantee. Unlike UDP, TCP ensures all packets arrive, even if it takes multiple retries. The humor comes from the self-aware admission that it might be slow, but it's dependable—a common trade-off in network protocols."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did UDP tell a joke? It doesn't care if you got it."
  explanation: "UDP is a connectionless protocol that doesn't verify if data was received. This joke uses the misdirection pattern where UDP's technical characteristic (no delivery confirmation) is applied to joke-telling, creating humor through the protocol's 'indifferent' nature."
  rating: 9

- text: "HTTP walked into a bar and ordered a GET request. The bartender said, 'That'll be 200 OK.'"
  explanation: "This joke combines the familiar 'walked into a bar' setup with HTTP status codes. The '200 OK' response code indicates success, which doubles as the bartender's acknowledgment, creating a double meaning between technical terminology and everyday conversation."
  rating: 6

- text: "ICMP is just ping with anxiety."
  explanation: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used by the ping utility to test connectivity. The humor comes from personifying ICMP as anxious, since it constantly checks 'Are you there? Are you still there?'—reflecting the protocol's diagnostic nature through human emotion."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't network protocols go to therapy? Because they have too many layers of issues."
  explanation: "This joke references the OSI model's seven layers while using 'layers of issues' as a psychological metaphor. The double meaning creates humor by applying technical architecture to emotional complexity, suggesting protocols are as complicated as people."
  rating: 7

- text: "FTP: 'I'll send you the file.' Also FTP: 'But first, let me tell everyone about it on port 21.'"
  explanation: "FTP uses separate control (port 21) and data connections, making it notoriously difficult to firewall. The joke personifies FTP as someone who can't help but broadcast their intentions before acting, highlighting this security and complexity issue."
  rating: 6

- text: "A packet walks into a network. The router says, 'Sorry, TTL expired.' The packet replies, 'Story of my life.'"
  explanation: "TTL (Time To Live) prevents packets from circulating forever by decrementing with each hop. The existential humor comes from the packet accepting its mortality philosophically, turning a technical timeout into a commentary on life's brevity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the DNS query go to therapy? It had unresolved issues."
  explanation: "DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses. The wordplay on 'unresolved' works both technically (failed DNS lookups) and psychologically (emotional problems), creating a simple but effective double meaning that resonates with both contexts."
  rating: 9

- text: "HTTPS is just HTTP who learned from their mistakes and now won't talk without a lawyer present."
  explanation: "HTTPS adds SSL/TLS encryption to HTTP, making communication secure. The joke personifies this as paranoia learned from experience, where the 'lawyer' is the encryption certificate—a humorous take on security as legal protection."
  rating: 8

- text: "SSH: Because telnet was too honest about its feelings."
  explanation: "Telnet transmits everything in plaintext, while SSH encrypts all communication. The joke uses emotional metaphor where encryption becomes 'privacy' and plaintext becomes being 'too honest'—highlighting the security improvement through relationship dynamics."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the SYN packet feel lonely? Because it kept waiting for an ACK that never came."
  explanation: "The TCP three-way handshake starts with SYN, expects SYN-ACK, then sends ACK. A missing response creates a half-open connection. The joke anthropomorphizes this as unrequited communication, turning a timeout into romantic rejection."
  rating: 7

- text: "ARP: 'Who has this IP?' Everyone: *silence* ARP: 'WHO HAS THIS IP?!' Still no one: 'Okay, I'll just broadcast this to literally everyone.'"
  explanation: "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) broadcasts requests to find which MAC address owns an IP. The joke shows ARP's escalating desperation as it's forced to shout at everyone, personifying the protocol as increasingly frustrated by network silence."
  rating: 8

- text: "SMTP and POP3 walk into a bar. SMTP says, 'I'll push.' POP3 says, 'I'll pull.' IMAP walks in and says, 'Why not both?'"
  explanation: "This joke contrasts email protocols: SMTP pushes mail to servers, POP3 pulls and deletes, while IMAP syncs bidirectionally. The 'why not both' punchline positions IMAP as the reasonable compromise, highlighting protocol evolution through bar conversation."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the network engineer break up with BGP? Too many commitment issues—it kept finding alternate paths."
  explanation: "BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) maintains multiple routes and switches paths based on policies. The relationship metaphor frames BGP's redundancy as infidelity, where having backup routes becomes romantic unreliability—a clever application of network resilience to trust issues."
  rating: 7

- text: "IPv4 to IPv6: 'I'm running out of addresses.' IPv6: 'Here, have 340 undecillion.' IPv4: 'That seems excessive.' IPv6: 'You're one to talk, you gave MIT a whole /8.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the address exhaustion problem and wasteful early allocations. The humor comes from IPv4's hypocrisy—complaining about IPv6's abundance while having squandered its own space. The specific MIT reference adds insider knowledge credibility."
  rating: 9

- text: "DHCP is that friend who always assigns you tasks but calls it 'dynamic' and 'helpful.'"
  explanation: "DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses, which is genuinely helpful but mandatory. The joke reframes this automation as a controlling friend who disguises demands as favors, playing on the word 'dynamic' to suggest someone who won't take no for an answer."
  rating: 7

- text: "Three protocols walk into a subnet: TCP checks if everyone arrived, UDP doesn't care, and ICMP just came to complain about the traffic."
  explanation: "This joke efficiently captures three protocol personalities: TCP's reliability obsession, UDP's indifference, and ICMP's role in error reporting. The subnet setting and 'complaining about traffic' creates a complete narrative that demonstrates each protocol's core characteristic."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't routers ever win arguments? Because they always see both sides and just forward the packets."
  explanation: "Routers forward packets without taking sides in communication. The joke personifies this neutrality as conflict avoidance, where technical impartiality becomes social fence-sitting. The wordplay on 'seeing both sides' works both technically (multiple interfaces) and socially (being diplomatic)."
  rating: 6

- text: "NTP walks into a bar at 3:47 PM. The bartender says, 'You're late!' NTP replies, 'Actually, according to my atomic clock, YOU'RE 3 milliseconds fast, and let me tell you about stratum levels...'"
  explanation: "NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronizes clocks with obsessive precision using hierarchical stratum levels. The joke captures the protocol's pedantic nature by making it the insufferable person who can't just apologize but must explain why everyone else is wrong—perfectly embodying NTP's purpose."
  rating: 9

- text: "REST API and SOAP got into a fight. REST said, 'You're too complicated!' SOAP replied, 'At least I have standards!' Then GraphQL walked in and said, 'Why are you both giving me everything when I only asked for the username?'"
  explanation: "This joke contrasts three API paradigms: REST's simplicity, SOAP's rigid standards, and GraphQL's precise querying. The punchline cleverly criticizes over-fetching in REST/SOAP while positioning GraphQL as the exasperated voice of reason—a sophisticated commentary on API evolution."
  rating: 10

- text: "A network packet's last words before being dropped: 'Tell my checksums... they were correct...'"
  explanation: "This darkly humorous joke personifies a packet's final moments before being discarded. Despite having valid checksums (data integrity), it still gets dropped—perhaps due to congestion or TTL expiration. The dramatic dying declaration parodies movie death scenes while highlighting that correctness doesn't guarantee delivery, a profound truth about networking."
