- text: "My first program printed 'Hello World'. My second program printed 'Goodbye, Sanity'."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the traditional 'Hello World' first program by contrasting the optimistic beginning with the reality of programming frustration. The progression from 'Hello' to 'Goodbye' and 'World' to 'Sanity' creates a humorous descent that many learners experience."

- text: "Why do programming students love coffee? Because Java keeps them awake!"
  explanation: "A simple double meaning joke playing on 'Java' as both a programming language commonly taught to students and a colloquial term for coffee. The setup uses the familiar student-coffee relationship."
  rating: 4

- text: "I spent six months learning to code. Now I know 247 ways to be wrong."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke highlights the learning process where students encounter countless errors before finding success. The specific number '247' adds humorous precision to the exaggeration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Teaching programming is easy. You just repeat yourself until you throw an error."
  explanation: "This joke uses programming terminology (loops and error throwing) to describe the teaching process, creating incongruity between human teaching and computer behavior patterns."
  rating: 8

- text: "My coding bootcamp promised I'd be job-ready in 12 weeks. They were right—I'm ready to quit."
  explanation: "A misdirection joke where 'job-ready' is reinterpreted from 'ready to get a job' to 'ready to quit,' commenting on the intense pressure and unrealistic expectations of bootcamps."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a computer science student and a philosopher? The student knows their problems have solutions."
  explanation: "This superiority theory joke creates a comparison that highlights the concrete, solvable nature of programming problems versus abstract philosophical questions, while gently mocking both fields."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my professor why my code didn't work. He said, 'Have you tried reading the error message?' I said, 'There's useful information in there?'"
  explanation: "This joke captures the common student experience of ignoring error messages, which are actually designed to help. The innocent question reveals the learning gap humorously."
  rating: 6

- text: "Day 1: Programming is logical and beautiful. Day 30: I've been debugging a semicolon for three hours."
  explanation: "A progression joke showing the evolution from naive optimism to harsh reality. The specific detail of debugging a semicolon (a common beginner mistake) adds authenticity."
  rating: 9

- text: "My teacher said programming is like writing poetry. He forgot to mention it's poetry that judges you harshly for every punctuation mistake."
  explanation: "This joke extends a common metaphor (programming as poetry) but adds the incongruous element of immediate, harsh judgment, contrasting the forgiving nature of literary poetry."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the student bring a ladder to programming class? To reach the higher-level languages!"
  explanation: "A play on 'higher-level' languages (like Python vs assembly) combined with the physical metaphor of climbing. The absurdity of bringing an actual ladder creates the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "I finally understand recursion! Now I just need to understand recursion."
  explanation: "A self-referential joke that demonstrates recursion while claiming to understand it. The structure mirrors the concept it describes, creating meta-humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "Online tutorial: 'This is simple!' My code: 'I beg to differ.'"
  explanation: "This joke captures the frustration when tutorials claim simplicity but implementation proves difficult. Anthropomorphizing the code adds to the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "How many programming students does it take to change a lightbulb? None—that's a hardware problem."
  explanation: "A classic format joke that plays on the software/hardware divide and the tendency of programmers to avoid physical problems, reflecting actual student attitudes."
  rating: 7

- text: "My programming professor said I'd learn from my mistakes. At this rate, I'll be the most educated person alive."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor using logical extension: if mistakes equal learning, and the student makes many mistakes, then they must be learning a lot. The exaggeration creates the punchline."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a programming student's favorite exercise? Running code. What's their least favorite? Running outside."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke playing on 'running' in both programming and physical contexts, highlighting the stereotypical sedentary nature of programming students."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my friend I was learning object-oriented programming. He asked if I was finally getting my life organized. I said, 'No, but my classes are.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on multiple meanings: 'object-oriented' and 'organized,' plus 'classes' as both programming constructs and educational courses, creating layered humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do programming students make terrible comedians? Their jokes only work in specific environments."
  explanation: "A meta-joke about programming humor itself, referencing how code requires specific environments to run, while suggesting programming students' jokes are too technical or context-dependent."
  rating: 8

- text: "First year: 'I don't understand pointers.' Second year: 'I understand pointers!' Third year: 'Nobody understands pointers.' Fourth year: 'Pointers understand me.'"
  explanation: "A progression joke showing the evolution of understanding through multiple stages, ending with an absurd reversal where the student becomes one with the concept. This captures the journey from confusion to mastery to existential acceptance."
  rating: 10

- text: "My code review came back with 47 comments. Turns out my professor doesn't accept 'it works on my machine' as documentation."
  explanation: "This joke references the infamous programmer excuse 'it works on my machine' while highlighting the educational reality that working code isn't enough—proper documentation and standards matter."
  rating: 8

- text: "Stack Overflow: Where students go to copy answers. GitHub: Where students go to copy questions."
  explanation: "A clever reversal joke that plays on academic dishonesty while accurately describing how students use these platforms. The parallel structure (copy answers/copy questions) creates satisfying symmetry."
  rating: 9

- text: "I finally achieved 100% test coverage in my student project. Turns out I only had one test that always returned true."
  explanation: "This joke is a perfect blend of technical accuracy and absurdity. It highlights how metrics can be gamed and reveals a common student mistake of writing tests that don't actually test anything, all while maintaining the appearance of success. The humor comes from the technical correctness of achieving 100% coverage while completely missing the point of testing."
