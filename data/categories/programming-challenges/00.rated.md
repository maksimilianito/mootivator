- text: "I entered a coding competition. Lost to a guy who solved everything in O(1). Turns out he just hardcoded all the answers."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the incongruity between algorithmic efficiency (O(1) time complexity being optimal) and the reality that hardcoding isn't actually solving the problem algorithmically. It's a misdirection where we expect genius optimization but get lazy cheating instead."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer fail the coding interview? He couldn't handle the pressure of a timed challenge."
  explanation: "A simple setup-punchline joke that uses double meaning - 'handle' is both a programming term and a general ability to cope with stress. The humor is mild, relying on the relatable experience of interview anxiety."
  rating: 4

- text: "My solution passed all test cases except the hidden ones. Apparently 'return 42' isn't always the answer to life, the universe, and algorithmic problems."
  explanation: "This combines the cultural reference to Hitchhiker's Guide with the common frustration of passing visible test cases but failing hidden edge cases. The incongruity is between philosophical answers and computational correctness."
  rating: 7

- text: "Competitive programmer's pickup line: 'Are you a sorting algorithm? Because I'd like to spend O(n log n) time with you.'"
  explanation: "This applies technical terminology to romantic situations, creating humor through the absurdity of using Big-O notation in dating. The joke works on the incongruity of cold mathematical language in an emotional context."
  rating: 6

- text: "I optimized my solution from O(n²) to O(n log n). The judge still said 'Time Limit Exceeded.' I optimized my career to O(1) and quit."
  explanation: "This escalates from technical optimization to life decisions, using the relief theory - it's a humorous way to vent frustration about impossible constraints. The absurdity of applying algorithmic notation to quitting creates the punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a competitive programmer's favorite exercise? Dynamic programming - they never solve the same subproblem twice, unlike their gym routine."
  explanation: "This creates humor through contrast between the efficiency of dynamic programming (memoization) and the irony of programmers' stereotypically poor exercise habits. It's self-deprecating while being technically accurate."
  rating: 7

- text: "Coding competition rule: If your solution works, you didn't read the problem correctly."
  explanation: "This aphorism captures the paranoia and self-doubt of competitive programming through exaggeration. It's funny because it reflects the real experience of thinking something is too easy and suspecting you've misunderstood."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't competitive programmers use recursion in real life? Stack overflow at family reunions."
  explanation: "This joke applies a technical concept (stack overflow from deep recursion) to social situations. The double meaning of 'stack overflow' (both technical error and metaphorical overload) creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "My debugging strategy for coding competitions: change random things until it works. I call it 'Monte Carlo optimization.'"
  explanation: "This elevates a desperate, unscientific approach by giving it a legitimate-sounding algorithmic name. The humor comes from the contrast between sophisticated terminology and chaotic methodology."
  rating: 8

- text: "I solved a graph problem using DFS. The interviewer asked why not BFS. I said I prefer depth over breadth in my relationships too. I'm still single."
  explanation: "This creates a story arc that connects algorithm choice to personal life, with a self-deprecating punchline. The joke works through the absurd application of technical preferences to romance."
  rating: 6

- text: "LeetCode Easy: I got this. LeetCode Medium: I got this? LeetCode Hard: This got me."
  explanation: "This progression joke uses parallel structure and escalating reversal to show the humbling experience of increasing difficulty. The final reversal of subject and object creates the punchline."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer bring a ladder to the coding competition? To reach the optimal solution."
  explanation: "This uses the physical metaphor of 'reaching' a solution literally. The absurdity of needing a physical ladder for a mental challenge creates simple, accessible humor."
  rating: 3

- text: "My code failed with 'Wrong Answer on test case 47.' I don't even want to know what monster input they created for case 47."
  explanation: "This captures the specific anxiety of failing mysterious test cases. The humor is in the personification of test cases as intentionally malicious 'monsters' and the arbitrary specificity of 'case 47.'"
  rating: 6

- text: "Competitive programming taught me that there's always a faster solution. Life taught me that sometimes O(n²) is good enough if n is your number of friends."
  explanation: "This combines technical knowledge with philosophical reflection, creating humor through the unexpected application of algorithmic analysis to social life, with a self-deprecating edge about having few friends."
  rating: 9

- text: "I used binary search to find my skill level in competitive programming. Turns out it's somewhere between 'Hello World' and 'Stack Overflow.'"
  explanation: "This applies a classic algorithm to self-assessment, with humor in the humbling range between basic and desperate. The reference to Stack Overflow as a skill level rather than a resource adds layers."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a programmer who solves problems in polynomial time? Optimistic."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated joke for those familiar with computational complexity theory (P vs NP). The humor is in the understatement - polynomial time is actually good, but the joke implies even that's unrealistic."
  rating: 8

- text: "My approach to algorithmic puzzles: read problem, think deeply for 30 seconds, Google 'similar problems,' copy approach, adjust variable names, submit, repeat."
  explanation: "This honestly describes a common but rarely admitted strategy, creating humor through confession. The mechanical breakdown of the process adds to the comedic effect of reducing problem-solving to pattern matching."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the competitive programmer refuse to use bubble sort? He had standards. Low standards, but standards."
  explanation: "This joke builds up expectation of high principles, then deflates it with the punchline. The humor is in the minimal pride of avoiding only the worst algorithm while implying everything else is fair game."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally solved a problem that stumped me for hours. Turns out I was overthinking it. The solution was just a nested for-loop. My CS professor is crying somewhere."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the anticlimax of a simple solution after intense effort, plus the imagined disappointment of an academic who taught better algorithms. It's relatable and self-aware."
  rating: 7

- text: "Coding competitions: where you spend 2 hours optimizing an algorithm to run in 0.5 seconds instead of 0.6 seconds, then spend 3 hours debugging why it prints an extra space."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurd priorities in competitive programming through contrast. The joke is in the disproportionate time spent on trivial formatting versus actual algorithmic improvement, capturing real frustration humorously."
  rating: 8

- text: "They said competitive programming would make me a better developer. Now I can optimize a Fibonacci sequence seven different ways but still can't center a div."
  explanation: "This is the crescendo joke, contrasting impressive algorithmic knowledge with basic practical skills. The specific, relatable reference to the notorious CSS centering problem makes it resonate with developers while highlighting the gap between competitive programming and real-world development. The absurdity of the mismatch creates strong humor through incongruity."
