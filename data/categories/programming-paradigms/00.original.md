- text: "Functional programmers don't have side effects. They have unintended features."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the functional programming principle of avoiding side effects (unintended changes to state), while using the classic programmer's defense of calling bugs 'features.' It's a gentle wordplay that introduces the category."

- text: "Why did the object-oriented programmer get stuck in the shower? The shampoo bottle said 'Lather, Rinse, Repeat' but didn't specify the exit condition."
  explanation: "This uses the classic infinite loop setup with OOP context. The humor comes from applying programming logic (missing loop termination) to everyday life, highlighting how programmers think differently about instructions."

- text: "Procedural programming: Do this, then do that. Object-oriented programming: Ask this thing to do that. Functional programming: What is 'do'?"
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating philosophical abstraction to characterize three paradigms. The punchline plays on functional programming's focus on pure computation over actions, creating incongruity through existential questioning."

- text: "An object-oriented programmer writes a suicide note. It reads: 'Goodbye, cruel world.' Then inherits depression from parent class."
  explanation: "Dark but work-safe humor that uses OOP inheritance concepts. The joke works on two levels: the literal inheritance mechanism and the metaphorical inheritance of mental health issues, creating unexpected technical-emotional connection."

- text: "Functional programming is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, and everyone claims they're doing it."
  explanation: "This classic joke structure applies perfectly to functional programming's reputation. It uses the superiority theory by poking fun at the gap between hype and actual practice in the programming community."

- text: "Why do functional programmers prefer to date immutable partners? Because changing state always leads to unexpected behavior."
  explanation: "This plays on functional programming's core principle of immutability (unchanging data) and applies it humorously to relationships. The technical term 'state' creates a double meaning with emotional states."

- text: "Object-oriented programming: Your code is a kingdom of nouns. Functional programming: Your code is a sentence with too many verbs. Procedural programming: Your code is a recipe your grandmother would understand."
  explanation: "This categorizes paradigms through linguistic metaphors. It creates humor through the contrast between abstract (kingdom), chaotic (too many verbs), and homely (grandmother's recipe) characterizations."

- text: "I tried to explain monads to my therapist. Now they need a therapist."
  explanation: "This short joke plays on the notorious difficulty of understanding monads in functional programming. The recursive nature of the problem (therapist needing therapy) mirrors the recursive confusion monads cause."

- text: "In object-oriented programming, the problem is that you wanted a banana but got a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle."
  explanation: "This references a famous Joe Armstrong quote about OOP's tendency toward over-complexity. The absurd escalation from banana to gorilla to jungle creates vivid imagery of dependency problems."

- text: "Why did the functional programmer refuse to go to parties? Too many side effects and not enough referential transparency."
  explanation: "This applies functional programming jargon to social situations. 'Side effects' (unpredictable social interactions) and 'referential transparency' (predictable behavior) create a humorous character portrait of an antisocial programmer."

- text: "Declarative programming: Tell the computer what you want. Imperative programming: Tell the computer how to get it. Reality: Tell the computer both and still get something completely different."
  explanation: "This sets up a classic programming paradigm distinction, then subverts it with the universal programmer experience of things not working as expected, creating humor through shared frustration."

- text: "A procedural programmer walks into a bar, orders a beer, drinks it, pays, and leaves. An object-oriented programmer walks into a bar and asks the bar to serve them. A functional programmer walks into a bar and returns a new programmer who has been to a bar."
  explanation: "This joke elegantly demonstrates three paradigms through parallel structure. The functional punchline is particularly clever, showing immutability (original programmer unchanged) and pure functions (returning new state)."

- text: "My code is perfectly object-oriented. It's just that all my objects are oriented toward the trash can."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor using wordplay on 'oriented.' The joke acknowledges poor code quality while technically maintaining the OOP terminology, creating humor through double meaning."

- text: "Why do logic programmers make terrible liars? Because they can only tell you what's true or fail silently."
  explanation: "This references Prolog and logic programming, where operations either succeed with truth or fail. The application to human behavior creates an unexpected connection between programming paradigms and personality traits."

- text: "Event-driven programming is like being in a relationship: you never know when something's going to trigger an unexpected reaction, and you spend most of your time handling callbacks from past mistakes."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares event-driven architecture to relationship dynamics. The technical terms 'trigger,' 'callbacks,' and 'handling' all have double meanings that create layered humor about both programming and life."

- text: "I wrote my dating profile in functional programming style. It's pure, has no side effects, and nobody can understand it."
  explanation: "This applies functional programming principles to dating with perfect parallel structure. Each characteristic (pure, no side effects, incomprehensible) works both technically and romantically, creating multi-layered humor."

- text: "Object-oriented design is like a dysfunctional family: everyone inherits their parents' problems, siblings fight over shared resources, and encapsulation just means hiding your issues from the outside world."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke maps OOP concepts (inheritance, shared resources, encapsulation) to family therapy terminology. The systematic parallel creates both recognition and surprise through the psychological reframing."

- text: "Why did the aspect-oriented programmer get fired from the restaurant? They kept adding cross-cutting concerns to everyone's orders. 'You wanted a burger? Let me inject some logging, authentication, and transaction management into that.'"
  explanation: "This joke requires knowledge of aspect-oriented programming's cross-cutting concerns concept. The absurdity of applying software architecture patterns to food orders creates vivid, unexpected humor through domain transfer."

- text: "Reactive programming is just event-driven programming that went to yoga, discovered mindfulness, and now won't shut up about observables and streams of consciousness."
  explanation: "This uses cultural stereotypes about wellness enthusiasts to characterize the relationship between programming paradigms. The wordplay on 'streams of consciousness' (technical vs. psychological) adds sophisticated layering."

- text: "A metaprogrammer walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll it be?' The metaprogrammer says, 'I'll have whatever I'm about to order.' The bar then writes itself out of existence."
  explanation: "This high-level joke plays with metaprogramming's self-referential nature and creates a logical paradox. The escalation to existential crisis (bar ceasing to exist) adds absurdist humor to the technical concept."

- text: "They say paradigms are just tools and you should use the right one for the job. That's why I use object-oriented programming for everything. I only have one tool, but I've inherited it from my father, who inherited it from his father, and it has so many decorators you can't tell what it originally was."
  explanation: "This masterfully weaves together multiple OOP concepts (inheritance, decorators) with the anti-pattern of paradigm dogmatism. The generational inheritance metaphor creates a perfect parallel between family tradition and bad programming practices, while the lost original purpose reflects real-world code entropy. It's simultaneously a critique of paradigm zealotry and a celebration of OOP terminology."
