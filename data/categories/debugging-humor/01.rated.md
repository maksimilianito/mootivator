- text: "My code works, but I don't know why. My code doesn't work, and I don't know why either."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common debugging experience where programmers often face both mysterious successes and failures, highlighting the frustrating lack of understanding in both scenarios."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the bugs are harder to see in the dark."
  explanation: "A play on words where 'bugs' refers both to software errors and actual insects attracted to light, using the incongruity between literal and metaphorical meanings."
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: "This captures the ironic situation where programmers must solve problems they themselves created, combining self-deprecation with the detective metaphor commonly used for debugging."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A reference to the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, satirizing the bad practice of testing code only after deployment when users can see the bugs."
  rating: 7

- text: "The best thing about a boolean is that even if you're wrong, you're only off by one bit."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the binary nature of booleans (true/false) and the common 'off-by-one' error in programming, creating a mathematical absurdity that minimizes the impact of being wrong."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'cache' sounds like 'cash,' connecting computer memory optimization with financial bankruptcy."
  rating: 5

- text: "Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack one by one, then realizing you needed the needles and the haystack was the problem."
  explanation: "This reverses the classic 'needle in a haystack' metaphor, capturing how debugging often reveals that your assumptions about what's wrong were completely backwards."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code has no bugs. It just develops random unexpected features."
  explanation: "The classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' defense, using corporate euphemism to reframe failures as intentional design choices."
  rating: 6

- text: "How do you generate a random string? Put a junior developer in front of VI and ask them to save and exit."
  explanation: "This pokes fun at VI editor's notoriously unintuitive interface, where confused users create random character sequences trying to escape, while also being a gentle jab at junior developers."
  rating: 8

- text: "I spent three hours debugging only to find the problem was a missing semicolon. The semicolon was in the error message the whole time."
  explanation: "This captures the frustrating reality where the solution is obvious in hindsight, and programmers often overlook the most direct clues while pursuing complex theories."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is 90% understanding and 10% fixing. Unfortunately, I spend 90% of my time not understanding."
  explanation: "A mathematical joke that adds up to 100% frustration, highlighting how most debugging time is spent in confusion rather than actually solving problems."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't programmers like nature? Too many bugs and no stack traces."
  explanation: "This contrasts the outdoor world with programming environments, where bugs (insects) are unavoidable and there's no helpful error information to guide you."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally found the bug! It was between the keyboard and the chair."
  explanation: "The classic PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair) joke, where the programmer humorously admits they themselves were the source of the error."
  rating: 5

- text: "Debugging someone else's code is like reading a mystery novel where you're the victim."
  explanation: "This extends the detective metaphor with a dark twist, capturing the painful experience of inheriting problematic code and having to suffer through understanding it."
  rating: 8

- text: "My debugging process: 1) That can't be the problem. 2) That shouldn't be the problem. 3) That wasn't the problem. 4) That was the problem."
  explanation: "A four-stage progression through denial that mirrors the scientific method gone wrong, showing how programmers' intuitions are often completely backwards."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the programmer quit debugging? He couldn't find the motivation. It was declared but never initialized."
  explanation: "A sophisticated programming joke using the concept of variable declaration versus initialization, applying programming logic to abstract concepts like motivation."
  rating: 8

- text: "I love debugging so much I add extra bugs to my code just so I can debug them later. Said no one ever."
  explanation: "A sarcastic reversal that emphasizes how universally hated debugging is, using the 'said no one ever' format to underscore the absurdity."
  rating: 4

- text: "Debugging is like trying to find a black cat in a dark room. Except there's no cat. And it's not a room. And you're not even sure what darkness is anymore."
  explanation: "This progressively deconstructs a metaphor to capture the existential confusion of deep debugging sessions where all your assumptions about reality break down."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks: 'Could you go to the store and get a liter of milk? If they have eggs, get six.' The programmer returns with six liters of milk. 'Why did you get so much milk?' 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "A classic logic joke where programming thinking (if-then conditions) is applied literally to everyday situations, resulting in absurd but technically correct behavior."
  rating: 10

- text: "There are two types of bugs: those that show up in testing and those that show up in the CEO's demo."
  explanation: "Murphy's Law applied to debugging, capturing the universal truth that the most embarrassing bugs only appear at the worst possible moments."
  rating: 8

- text: "After hours of debugging, I realized the code was working perfectly. The requirements were the bug."
  explanation: "The ultimate debugging revelation where the technical implementation is flawless but the fundamental assumptions were wrong, shifting blame to the specification itself and capturing the philosophical absurdity of 'correct' code that solves the wrong problem."
