- text: "My CPU has a memory hierarchy—it remembers everything except my deadlines."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'memory' in computer architecture (cache, RAM, storage hierarchy) versus human memory, highlighting the irony that sophisticated memory systems don't help with time management."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the processor go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses the technical concept of instruction dependencies in pipelining and applies it to psychological 'dependencies' or issues, creating incongruity between technical and emotional contexts."
  rating: 8

- text: "I optimized my code so much, even my CPU got confused about what it was supposed to do."
  explanation: "This joke plays on over-optimization leading to complexity, suggesting that extreme optimization can make code harder to understand even for the hardware executing it."
  rating: 6

- text: "Cache misses are just the universe's way of reminding you that nothing is ever where you expect it to be."
  explanation: "This applies the technical frustration of cache misses (when data isn't in fast memory) to a philosophical observation about life's unpredictability, creating a humorous parallel."
  rating: 8

- text: "My architecture supports out-of-order execution, which explains why I finish projects in random sequence."
  explanation: "Out-of-order execution is a CPU optimization technique where instructions execute non-sequentially. The joke applies this to poor project management, creating a self-deprecating excuse."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't processors ever win at poker? They always show their pipeline."
  explanation: "This is a pun on 'showing your hand' in poker versus the instruction pipeline in CPUs being visible/predictable, suggesting processors lack the ability to bluff."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my CPU about branch prediction. Now it assumes every relationship will fail."
  explanation: "Branch prediction is when CPUs guess which way conditional code will go. The joke anthropomorphizes this as pessimistic prediction about human relationships, playing on prediction going wrong."
  rating: 8

- text: "The cache and main memory had a fight. It was a classic case of hierarchy issues."
  explanation: "This uses 'hierarchy' both in its technical sense (memory hierarchy in computer architecture) and its social sense (power dynamics), creating a workplace-drama style joke about computer components."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the architect design a RISC processor? He wanted to keep things simple—until the compiler got involved."
  explanation: "RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) promises simplicity, but the joke reveals the irony that simplicity at one level creates complexity at another (compiler), a common architectural trade-off."
  rating: 7

- text: "My superscalar processor can execute multiple instructions simultaneously. I still can't multitask."
  explanation: "This contrasts the impressive parallel execution capability of superscalar architectures with human inability to multitask effectively, highlighting the superiority of hardware over our own limitations."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the memory controller break up with the CPU? Too much latency in their relationship."
  explanation: "Memory latency (delay in accessing data) is a key performance bottleneck. The joke applies this technical concept to relationship problems, where 'latency' becomes emotional distance or slow responses."
  rating: 9

- text: "I designed a CPU with speculative execution. Now it executes code I haven't even written yet and somehow it's still buggy."
  explanation: "Speculative execution runs code before knowing if it's needed. The absurdist humor suggests it's so aggressive it runs non-existent code, and humorously, even imaginary code has bugs."
  rating: 9

- text: "The L1 cache is like your best friend—small, fast, and always there when you need them. The L3 cache is like that acquaintance you see once a year."
  explanation: "This personifies the cache hierarchy (L1 being fastest and smallest, L3 being slower and larger) as different types of social relationships, making the technical hierarchy relatable through social metaphors."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do computer architects make terrible poets? They think iambic pentameter is a pipeline stage."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through the misdirection of expecting literary knowledge but getting technical interpretation instead, playing on 'meter' and 'pipeline stage' as technical terms."
  rating: 5

- text: "My CPU has hazard detection. I wish my life decisions had the same feature."
  explanation: "Pipeline hazards are conflicts in instruction execution that CPUs must detect and handle. The joke wishes for a similar automatic system to detect bad life choices, highlighting human fallibility."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer walks into a bar and orders 1.5 beers. The bartender says, 'We don't serve half beers.' The programmer replies, 'Then your architecture doesn't support floating-point operations in the ALU.'"
  explanation: "This joke combines the classic 'walks into a bar' format with technical knowledge about ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) and floating-point support, creating humor through the programmer's overly technical response to a simple situation."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the system architect refuse to use a bus topology? He was tired of everyone waiting in line and preferred a crossbar switch where everyone could talk at once—until they all did."
  explanation: "This joke explores the trade-offs between bus architectures (shared, sequential) and crossbar switches (parallel but expensive), with the punchline revealing that solving one problem creates another (contention)."
  rating: 8

- text: "My CPU supports transactional memory. I tried applying it to my bank account—turns out rollback only works in hardware."
  explanation: "Transactional memory allows atomic operations with rollback on failure. The joke humorously wishes this feature existed for financial mistakes, playing on the desire to undo real-world transactions like code transactions."
  rating: 9

- text: "A CISC processor and a RISC processor walk into a job interview. The CISC processor says, 'I can do anything!' The RISC processor says, 'I can do one thing really well.' They both got hired—the CISC for management, the RISC for actual work."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes the CISC vs RISC debate while also making a workplace observation about generalists versus specialists, with the punchline suggesting that doing one thing well is more valuable than claiming to do everything."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the computer architect get kicked out of the restaurant? He kept insisting the menu had poor spatial locality and the waiter's fetch pattern was suboptimal."
  explanation: "Spatial locality (accessing nearby memory) and fetch patterns are optimization concepts. The absurdist humor comes from applying these technical concerns to restaurant service, showing how architects see optimization problems everywhere."
  rating: 8

- text: "I implemented Tomasulo's algorithm in my daily life. Now I have a reservation station for every commitment, dynamic scheduling for every task, and I still can't figure out why I never finish anything—turns out infinite register renaming doesn't help when you have finite time."
  explanation: "This is advanced architectural humor referencing Tomasulo's algorithm (out-of-order execution with register renaming). The joke suggests that even sophisticated CPU optimization techniques can't solve fundamental human limitations, with the punchline revealing that hardware solutions don't translate to life management despite the elaborate setup."
