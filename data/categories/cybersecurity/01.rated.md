- text: "I changed my password to 'incorrect' so whenever I forget it, the system tells me 'Your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of error messages. The humor comes from the user cleverly exploiting the system's helpful feedback mechanism, creating a self-referencing loop where the error message actually reveals the password."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the hacker bring a ladder to the cyber caf√©? To access the cloud."
  explanation: "A simple pun that uses the double meaning of 'cloud' - both the physical clouds in the sky and cloud computing. The physical ladder creates an absurd visual image when applied to digital infrastructure."
  rating: 5

- text: "My password is so strong, even I can't remember it."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common security dilemma where strong passwords become too complex for users to remember, creating a paradox where security measures defeat their own purpose through impracticality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't hackers ever get locked out? They always find a backdoor."
  explanation: "A play on 'backdoor' which has both a literal meaning (alternative entrance to a house) and a technical meaning (unauthorized access point in software). The joke suggests hackers' persistence and resourcefulness."
  rating: 6

- text: "The best firewall is unplugging the computer."
  explanation: "This joke uses extreme literalism to make a point about security. While technically true that disconnection prevents network attacks, it defeats the purpose of having a computer, highlighting the tension between security and functionality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the security expert get fired? He kept testing the company's defenses... successfully."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that demonstrating security vulnerabilities (even to fix them) can be seen as threatening. It highlights the sometimes contradictory nature of security work where finding problems is both the job and potentially career-ending."
  rating: 8

- text: "Two-factor authentication: because your password is terrible and we both know it."
  explanation: "A brutally honest observation dressed as humor. It acknowledges the reality that most user passwords are weak, and 2FA exists as a necessary compensation for human password-choosing behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do cybersecurity experts make terrible friends? They never trust anyone and always assume the worst."
  explanation: "This joke personifies the 'zero trust' security model, applying professional paranoia to personal relationships. It's funny because it takes a necessary professional mindset and shows how absurd it would be in social contexts."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break, and now it won't stop sending me CAPTCHA tests."
  explanation: "A surreal joke that anthropomorphizes the computer while playing on the word 'break' (rest vs. breaking in). The computer misinterprets the request as suspicious activity, triggering security measures."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's a hacker's favorite season? Phishing season."
  explanation: "A pun on 'fishing season' and 'phishing' (fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information). The joke treats cybercrime like a recreational outdoor activity, creating an absurd parallel between leisure and cybercrime."
  rating: 5

- text: "My encryption is so good, I encrypted my encryption key and now nobody can decrypt anything."
  explanation: "This joke illustrates the recursive problem in security where protecting the protection mechanism creates an unsolvable situation. It's a practical demonstration of infinite regress in cryptography."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the hacker cross the road? To get to the other site."
  explanation: "A classic joke format with a technical twist. 'Site' sounds like 'side' but refers to websites, suggesting the hacker's motivation is always about accessing different systems rather than physical movement."
  rating: 4

- text: "I'm not saying our security is bad, but our password policy requires at least one character, and we're not sure if that's a letter or a person."
  explanation: "This joke uses ambiguity in the word 'character' (text symbol vs. person) to suggest extremely lax security standards. The uncertainty itself becomes the punchline, implying complete security incompetence."
  rating: 7

- text: "A hacker walks into a bar, a SQL injection, and the entire customer database."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke references SQL injection attacks where malicious code is inserted into input fields. The structure mimics 'walks into a bar' jokes but the punchline is the actual execution of an attack, with the bar's database being compromised."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't security cameras ever get promoted? They're always watching but never take action."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes security cameras while pointing out a real limitation of passive security measures - they record but don't prevent. It's a commentary on reactive versus proactive security."
  rating: 6

- text: "I implemented perfect security: nobody can access the system, including authorized users."
  explanation: "A darkly humorous take on over-securing systems. It achieves the goal of 'no unauthorized access' by preventing all access, highlighting the balance needed between security and usability."
  rating: 8

- text: "What did the firewall say to the suspicious packet? 'You shall not pass!' Then it let through an email attachment anyway."
  explanation: "This joke references both Lord of the Rings and the reality that firewalls often fail at their most important task - blocking malicious content in everyday communications like email attachments."
  rating: 7

- text: "A cybersecurity expert, a user, and their password walk into a bar. The expert says 'Qx$9mK!p2@Zn'. The user says 'password123'. The password says nothing because it's already been compromised."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke contrasts expert versus user password practices while personifying the password itself as a victim. The final twist that it's 'already compromised' suggests the futility of the entire conversation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the company hire a hacker as their security consultant? Because the best way to catch a thief is to hire one, then panic when you realize what you've done."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common practice of hiring 'ethical hackers' while acknowledging the inherent anxiety of giving system access to someone with hacking skills. The extended punchline adds a layer of realistic corporate paranoia."
  rating: 7

- text: "My smart home security system is so advanced, it locked me out and posted my embarrassing photos to social media to prove it was serious about protecting my privacy."
  explanation: "An absurdist take on IoT security failures where the security system becomes the threat. The irony of violating privacy to protect privacy creates a perfect paradox that reflects real concerns about smart home vulnerabilities."
  rating: 8

- text: "A penetration tester's report read: 'I got in through the front door because someone taped the password to the monitor, bypassed the firewall because it wasn't turned on, and accessed the database because the admin password was still 'admin'. But your antivirus subscription is current, so that's good.'"
  explanation: "This joke is a comprehensive satire of security theater where organizations focus on visible security measures while ignoring fundamental vulnerabilities. The anticlimax of praising the antivirus subscription after listing catastrophic failures perfectly captures the absurdity of misplaced security priorities."
