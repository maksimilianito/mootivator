```yaml
- text: "I read the MIT License. Still waiting for the acceptance letter."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'MIT License' - both the open-source software license and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's admission process. The humor comes from treating a software license as if it were a university application."

- text: "Why did the developer choose the Apache License? Because it had the best documentation."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke playing on Apache's reputation for comprehensive documentation. The humor is mild, relying on the recognition of Apache's brand identity in the open-source community."

- text: "GPL stands for 'Generally Pretty Lengthy.'"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay on the GNU General Public License acronym, referencing the notorious length and complexity of GPL license texts. The humor comes from the accurate observation packaged as a false definition."

- text: "What's a pirate's favorite software license? The ARR-GPL!"
  explanation: "This combines pirate stereotypes ('arr' as pirate speak) with the GPL license. It's a straightforward pun that plays on phonetic similarity, creating a lighthearted connection between software licensing and pirate culture."

- text: "I tried to read the Oracle license agreement, but my lawyer fell asleep first."
  explanation: "This joke references Oracle's notoriously complex and lengthy licensing terms. The humor comes from exaggerating the length and complexity to the point where even a legal professional can't stay awake through it."

- text: "Why don't proprietary software companies tell jokes? Because they're afraid someone will fork the punchline."
  explanation: "This plays on the open-source concept of 'forking' (creating a derivative version) and contrasts it with proprietary software's restrictive nature. The incongruity of applying software licensing concepts to joke-telling creates the humor."

- text: "My code is like the BSD license - permissive until someone actually tries to use it."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke plays on the BSD license's permissive nature while admitting the code quality is so poor that permissiveness doesn't help. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on what 'permissive' means in practice."

- text: "What's the difference between closed-source and open-source? One hides its bugs in compiled code, the other displays them proudly on GitHub."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory, poking fun at both proprietary and open-source approaches. The humor comes from the truthful observation that open-source transparency includes exposing flaws, while closed-source hides them."

- text: "I released my code under Creative Commons. Turns out nobody wanted to create anything with it."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke subverts expectations about Creative Commons licensing, which is meant to encourage creative reuse. The humor comes from the implication that the code is so poor that even permissive licensing can't help."

- text: "A developer walks into a bar and orders a beer. 'That'll be free,' says the bartender, 'but you have to share any improvements to the recipe.' The developer replied, 'Is this bar GPL-licensed?'"
  explanation: "This joke personifies the GPL's copyleft requirement in a real-world scenario. The humor comes from applying software licensing concepts to everyday transactions, highlighting the GPL's share-alike nature."

- text: "Why did the startup choose the Unlicense? Because their investors already owned everything anyway."
  explanation: "This joke combines the Unlicense (which dedicates code to public domain) with startup culture and venture capital dynamics. The dark humor comes from the truth about equity dilution in funded startups."

- text: "I asked my manager if I could open-source our code. He said, 'Sure, just remove all the parts that work first.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on corporate paranoia about releasing proprietary code while simultaneously being self-deprecating about code quality. The humor comes from the implication that the working code is minimal."

- text: "What do you call software with 47 different licenses in its dependencies? A lawyer's retirement plan."
  explanation: "This references the modern problem of dependency hell and license compatibility issues. The humor comes from exaggerating the complexity of multi-license projects into a profitable legal career."

- text: "I chose the WTFPL license for my project. My corporate users were not amused, but at least they read the license for once."
  explanation: "The WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License) is a real, extremely permissive license. The humor comes from the contrast between corporate formality and the license's irreverent name, plus the observation that shocking names make people actually read licenses."

- text: "Why do companies fear the AGPL? Because it's like GPL, but it can see you through the cloud."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the AGPL's network provision, which closes the 'SaaS loophole' of the GPL. The humor comes from personifying the license as omniscient and the paranoid corporate perspective on copyleft obligations."

- text: "A developer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Before entering, you must explain your most complex license violation.' The developer replied, 'This IS hell, isn't it?'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the absurdity technique, making license compliance so difficult that explaining violations becomes eternal punishment. It reflects the genuine anxiety developers feel about inadvertent license violations."

- text: "My code is dual-licensed: MIT for people I like, and 'good luck compiling it' for everyone else."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the concept of dual-licensing (usually commercial + open source) with a humorous alternative. The humor comes from replacing formal licensing with petty personal preferences and the implication that the code is poorly documented."

- text: "Why did the open-source project switch from GPL to MIT? They realized their code was so bad that copyleft was actually protecting users from derivatives."
  explanation: "This sophisticated self-deprecating joke inverts the purpose of copyleft licenses. Instead of protecting user freedom, the GPL is humorously portrayed as protecting users from more bad code, making permissive licensing a public service."

- text: "I wrote a license that requires users to star the GitHub repo. My lawyer said it's unenforceable. I said, 'So is the GPL without lawyers.'"
  explanation: "This meta-joke comments on license enforcement challenges while proposing an absurd alternative obligation. The humor comes from the valid observation that all licenses depend on enforcement mechanisms, and the vanity of requiring GitHub stars."

- text: "What's the most honest software license? 'Use at your own risk, because I wrote this at 3 AM and I'm not even sure it works, but somehow it passed the tests, which I also wrote at 3 AM.'"
  explanation: "This joke proposes a brutally honest alternative to formal liability disclaimers found in real licenses. The humor comes from the escalating admissions of questionable development practices that many developers secretly relate to."

- text: "A GPL zealot, an MIT pragmatist, and a proprietary developer walk into a bar. The zealot says the bar should be free for all. The pragmatist says do whatever you want with the bar. The proprietary developer says, 'I can't tell you what I'm drinking, but you can license the recipe for $50,000 per seat.' The bartender says, 'Get out, all of you. This is a brewery, and you're violating my trademark.'"
  explanation: "This complex joke satirizes all three licensing philosophies while adding a fourth layer about intellectual property types. The humor builds through each character representing their licensing philosophy absurdly, culminating in the bartender's practical concern about a completely different IP issue. It's a meta-commentary on how licensing debates often miss the bigger picture."
