```yaml
- text: My linked list keeps pointing to its ex. Should I set it to null?
  explanation: This joke plays on the double meaning of "pointing" - both in the technical sense of pointers in linked lists and the emotional sense of still being attached to a past relationship. The solution (setting to null) works both technically and as relationship advice.

- text: Why did the array go to therapy? It had zero-based issues.
  explanation: A simple pun combining the technical concept of zero-based indexing in arrays with the colloquial phrase "deep-seated issues." The unexpected twist is that the array's problems are literally based on zero.

- text: I tried to organize my life like a hash table, but I keep having collisions with my ex.
  explanation: This joke uses the technical concept of hash collisions (when two keys map to the same location) as a metaphor for awkwardly running into an ex-partner, creating an incongruous comparison between data structures and social situations.

- text: Trees have better family relationships than I do - at least they know who their parent nodes are.
  explanation: Self-deprecating humor that contrasts the clear parent-child relationships in tree data structures with complicated human family dynamics, using technical terminology to comment on personal life.

- text: My stack overflow isn't just a website I visit - it's my entire debugging strategy.
  explanation: A meta-joke playing on the double meaning of "stack overflow" as both a technical error condition and the popular programming Q&A website, while also admitting to over-reliance on online help.

- text: Why don't binary trees ever feel lonely? Because they always have two children or none at all - no middle child syndrome!
  explanation: This joke applies the strict structural rules of binary trees (maximum two children per node) to human family psychology, creating humor through the unexpected application of computer science to social dynamics.

- text: I implemented a circular linked list for my to-do list. Now I'm stuck in an infinite loop of procrastination.
  explanation: The joke uses the technical property of circular linked lists (no end point) as a metaphor for endless procrastination, where the structure itself becomes the problem rather than the solution.

- text: A programmer's spouse asked, "Why do you keep talking about your 'heap'?" He replied, "Because my stack is full of local problems that disappear when I go to sleep."
  explanation: This joke cleverly contrasts heap memory (persistent, dynamic allocation) with stack memory (temporary, local scope) while creating a metaphor for dealing with daily problems versus long-term issues in a relationship.

- text: My dating life is like a singly linked list - I can only look forward, and going back requires traversing the entire painful history.
  explanation: Uses the technical limitation of singly linked lists (can only traverse in one direction) as a metaphor for being unable to revisit past relationships without reliving all the memories in sequence.

- text: Why did the graph data structure become a therapist? It was great at finding connections and detecting cycles of behavior!
  explanation: This joke plays on graph theory concepts (nodes/connections and cycle detection) and applies them to psychology, where therapists help patients understand relationship patterns and behavioral cycles.

- text: I told my friend I use a deque in my code. He said, "Isn't that just a fancy way of saying you can't decide which end to use?" I replied, "That's exactly why it's perfect for my indecisive lifestyle."
  explanation: The double-ended queue (deque) allows insertion and deletion from both ends, which becomes a humorous metaphor for indecisiveness, with the technical feature becoming a personality trait.

- text: An array and a linked list walk into a bar. The array says, "I'll have what's in position 5." The linked list says, "I'll have... wait, let me start from the beginning..."
  explanation: This classic setup-punchline structure contrasts O(1) array access with O(n) linked list traversal, personifying the data structures to highlight their fundamental performance differences in an everyday scenario.

- text: Why did the programmer use a tree structure for their family reunion? Because they wanted to avoid the awkward O(nÂ²) complexity of everyone talking to everyone else!
  explanation: This joke uses Big O notation and algorithmic complexity to describe social situations, where a hierarchical tree structure is humorously presented as more efficient than a fully connected graph of conversations.

- text: My boss asked me to implement a priority queue for our tasks. Now everything is priority one, and I've basically recreated a regular queue with extra anxiety.
  explanation: This joke satirizes workplace culture where everything becomes "urgent," rendering the sophisticated priority queue data structure functionally equivalent to a simple FIFO queue, but with added stress.

- text: I tried to explain to my date that I'm like a balanced AVL tree - I automatically rotate to maintain equilibrium. She said I was just spinning in circles and left.
  explanation: The joke uses the self-balancing property of AVL trees (which perform rotations to maintain balance) but reframes it as a negative personality trait, with the technical precision becoming social awkwardness.

- text: A junior developer asked, "Why do we use trees?" The senior replied, "Because we tried using graphs for our project structure, and now nobody knows what depends on what, everyone's connected to everyone, and our deployment looks like a social network for code that hates itself."
  explanation: This extended joke contrasts the clean hierarchy of trees with the potential chaos of general graphs, using workplace frustration and anthropomorphized code to create relatable humor about software architecture decisions.

- text: Why did the hash table break up with the binary search tree? The hash table said, "You're always so balanced and organized. I need someone who understands that life is messy, collisions happen, and sometimes O(1) chaos is better than O(log n) perfection."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke personifies two data structures with different philosophies, contrasting the hash table's average-case speed with occasional collisions against the BST's consistent but slower logarithmic performance, creating a metaphor for different life approaches.

- text: A programmer implemented a skip list for their career plan. Their friend asked, "Isn't that overly complicated?" They replied, "Yes, but now I can skip levels probabilistically, which is exactly how corporate promotions work anyway - random chance with occasional fast-forwards for the lucky ones."
  explanation: This meta-joke uses the skip list's probabilistic level-skipping mechanism as a cynical but humorous commentary on corporate advancement, where the technical randomness mirrors perceived workplace unfairness.

- text: My therapist asked me to describe my childhood. I said, "Imagine a B-tree where every node split before I could form a stable attachment, resulting in shallow relationships with maximum branching factor but minimum emotional depth." She replied, "That's the most technically accurate description of abandonment issues I've ever heard. Also, you need more friends outside of computer science."
  explanation: This joke uses the technical properties of B-trees (splitting nodes, branching factors, shallow depth) to create an absurdly precise metaphor for psychological issues, with the punchline acknowledging the over-application of technical thinking to human problems.

- text: A philosopher and a programmer argued about data structures. The philosopher said, "A tree falling in the forest with no one around makes no sound." The programmer replied, "A tree with no pointers to it gets garbage collected. At least in my world, we clean up our existential crises automatically."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke combines the classic philosophical thought experiment with memory management concepts, creating a humorous contrast between philosophical pondering and practical programming solutions, while suggesting that programmers have automated solutions even for existential problems.

- text: Why did the Trie data structure win the spelling bee? Because it had perfect prefix matching, autocomplete capabilities, and had literally memorized every word by storing them character-by-character in a tree structure. The judges said it was cheating. The Trie said, "No, I'm just optimized for exactly this use case - unlike you humans with your inefficient neural networks and occasional typos." They banned it, but it still maintains a website offering spelling suggestions.
  explanation: This extended narrative joke personifies a Trie data structure, using its specific technical properties (prefix matching, efficient string storage) to create an absurd scenario where a data structure competes with humans. The multiple layers include the technical accuracy of Trie capabilities, the humor of calling human brains "inefficient," and the meta-joke ending about spell-checkers, which actually do use Tries.
