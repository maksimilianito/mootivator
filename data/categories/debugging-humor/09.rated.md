- text: "I spent three hours debugging my code. Turns out I was looking at the wrong file."
  explanation: "This joke uses simple irony and misdirection. The programmer's effort was completely wasted due to a basic mistake, highlighting the absurdity of how debugging can go wrong in the most mundane ways."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer's bug report get rejected? It was working fine on their machine."
  explanation: "This plays on the infamous 'works on my machine' excuse that developers often use, creating humor through the recognition of a common workplace situation that frustrates QA teams."
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor and the superiority theory to create self-deprecating humor. The programmer is both trying to solve the problem and is the cause of it, highlighting the ironic nature of debugging your own code."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It just develops random unexpected features."
  explanation: "This is classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' humor, using euphemism and reframing to defend problematic code in an absurd way."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? So the bugs can't see them coming."
  explanation: "This takes the literal meaning of 'bugs' and creates a humorous scenario where darkness helps hunting them, inverting the usual 'light attracts bugs' joke with a tactical twist."
  rating: 6

- text: "I fixed a bug yesterday. Today I have three new ones. I think they're reproducing."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes bugs as living creatures that breed, playing on the frustrating reality that fixing one bug often creates more, using biological metaphor for comedic effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a debugger's favorite exercise? Stack traces."
  explanation: "This is a simple pun combining fitness culture with programming terminology, where 'stack traces' sounds like a workout routine but is actually a debugging tool."
  rating: 4

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous but sometimes real practice of production testing, creating humor through relatable bad practices."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging: The art of removing the needles you carefully placed in the haystack."
  explanation: "This inverts the common 'needle in a haystack' metaphor, suggesting programmers create their own problems, using paradox and self-awareness for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer quit debugging? Because they couldn't handle the rejection from their own code."
  explanation: "This personifies code as something that rejects its creator, playing on emotional language typically used in relationships to describe the frustrating technical process."
  rating: 5

- text: "My debugging process: 1) Run code. 2) It breaks. 3) Add console.log everywhere. 4) Forget to remove them. 5) Ship it."
  explanation: "This humor comes from listing a realistic but unprofessional debugging workflow, building up to an absurd conclusion that many developers secretly recognize."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a bug that's been in production for three years? A legacy feature with loyal users."
  explanation: "This joke uses reframing and the passage of time to transform a bug into something valuable, satirizing how long-standing bugs become accepted parts of systems."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally found the bug after six hours. It was a semicolon. I'm now questioning my entire career."
  explanation: "This uses extreme contrast between effort and cause to create humor, highlighting the existential crisis that trivial bugs can cause after extensive debugging sessions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging is 90% understanding the problem and 10% blaming the compiler."
  explanation: "This subverts the expected wisdom about problem-solving by ending with the common (but irrational) practice of blaming tools, using misdirection and recognition of developer psychology."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't bugs ever go to therapy? Because they're always in denial about being caught."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes bugs with human psychological defense mechanisms, creating a layered joke about both debugging difficulty and human nature."
  rating: 5

- text: "I wrote a bug so complex it took two senior developers and a whiteboard to understand it. I'm oddly proud."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory inversely - taking pride in creating a problem rather than solving it, highlighting the absurd psychology of programming culture."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation and confidence."
  explanation: "This is a cynical aphorism that suggests bugs become features through presentation rather than fixing, using brevity and truth to create humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "I tried rubber duck debugging. The duck quit. Said my code was giving it an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This takes the real debugging technique of explaining code to a rubber duck and extends it absurdly by having the inanimate object respond with psychological distress."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging is like a mystery novel where the author, detective, victim, and murderer are all you, and you still can't figure out whodunit."
  explanation: "This expands on the detective metaphor by multiplying the roles, creating humor through the absurd complexity and self-contained nature of the debugging process."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the bug refuse to be fixed? It had been in the codebase so long it claimed squatter's rights."
  explanation: "This uses legal terminology and personification to describe legacy bugs, creating humor through the absurd application of property law to code maintenance."
  rating: 7

- text: "After hours of debugging, I finally found the issue: the code was doing exactly what I told it to do. I'm the bug."
  explanation: "This is the ultimate self-aware debugging joke, using dramatic irony and revelation to deliver the uncomfortable truth that most bugs are human errors, not computer failures. The twist ending and philosophical realization make it the most sophisticated joke in the set."
