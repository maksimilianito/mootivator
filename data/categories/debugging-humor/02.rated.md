- text: "Debugging: because 'It works on my machine' is never the end of the story."
  explanation: This joke plays on the common developer excuse when code fails in production but works locally, highlighting that this statement inevitably leads to more debugging rather than solving the problem.
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: A play on the famous "Most Interesting Man in the World" meme format, this jokes about the dangerous practice of debugging directly in live production environments, which is considered a major no-no but happens more often than developers admit.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Light mode attracts bugs."
  explanation: This uses a double meaning of 'bugs' - both software errors and actual insects attracted to light - creating incongruity between the technical and natural worlds.
  rating: 9

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It just develops random features."
  explanation: This is a classic "it's a feature, not a bug" joke that reframes software defects as intentional functionality, playing on the defensive rationalization developers sometimes use.
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: This creates humor through the absurd realization that programmers are both solving the mystery and the ones who created the problem in the first place, highlighting the self-inflicted nature of debugging.

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: A pun on 'cache' (computer memory) and 'cash' (money), this joke uses technical terminology with a double meaning to create wordplay humor.
  rating: 5

- text: "I finally found the bug after 6 hours. It was a missing semicolon. I'm not crying, you're crying."
  explanation: This captures the emotional rollercoaster of debugging, where massive time investment leads to discovering a trivial error, mixing frustration with self-deprecating humor.
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging: the art of removing the needles you carefully placed in the haystack."
  explanation: This reverses the common "needle in a haystack" metaphor to highlight how programmers create their own problems, then struggle to find them.
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer's wife asks him to go to the store: 'Buy a loaf of bread, and if they have eggs, get a dozen.' He returns with 12 loaves of bread."
  explanation: This joke exploits the literal interpretation of conditional logic that programmers develop, where 'if they have eggs' becomes the condition for 'get a dozen' applying to bread instead of eggs.
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do programmers hate nature? Too many bugs and no debugger."
  explanation: This creates humor by contrasting the natural world's literal bugs with software bugs, and noting the absence of debugging tools in real life.
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent all day debugging. Turns out I was editing the wrong file."
  explanation: This captures a painfully common debugging experience where the problem isn't in the code logic at all, but in a fundamental mistake about which file is actually running.
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging tip: If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0."
  explanation: This jokes about the practice of shipping buggy software and letting users find the problems, playing on the cynical reality of software releases.
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the bug go to therapy? It had too many issues."
  explanation: A simple pun on 'issues' meaning both personal problems and software bug reports, using the setup-punchline structure with technical wordplay.
  rating: 4

- text: "I don't need a debugger. I have print statements from 1987."
  explanation: This jokes about the primitive but reliable debugging technique of adding print statements, suggesting both its longevity and the developer's resistance to modern tools.
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging is 90% understanding the problem, 9% fixing it, and 1% wondering why it ever worked in the first place."
  explanation: This breaks down the debugging process with percentages that humorously highlight how often code works for mysterious reasons, creating a relatable experience for developers.
  rating: 8

- text: "My debugging process: 1) Panic 2) Coffee 3) More panic 4) Stack Overflow 5) Copy paste 6) It works somehow 7) Never touch that code again."
  explanation: This extended joke maps out a realistic but chaotic debugging workflow, escalating from panic to superstition, capturing the emotional journey and questionable practices developers actually use.
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: A multilayered pun combining vision problems with programming language names (C#), playing on the rivalry between Java and C# developers while using the setup-punchline format.
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break. Now it won't stop sending me breakpoint notifications."
  explanation: This creates humor through the double meaning of 'break' (rest vs. debugging breakpoint) and personifies the computer as misunderstanding the request, showing incongruity between human needs and technical interpretation.
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is like a murder mystery except you're both the detective and the murderer, and the victim is your sanity, and the crime scene is your entire codebase, and you can't remember what happened, and the only witness is a rubber duck."
  explanation: This extended metaphor keeps escalating absurdly, incorporating the famous 'rubber duck debugging' technique while painting an increasingly chaotic picture of the debugging experience that builds to a hilarious crescendo.

- text: "Two programmers walk into a bar. The first one orders a beer. The second one orders 0 beers. The third one orders -1 beers. The fourth one orders NULL beers. The fifth one orders 999999999 beers. The bartender crashes."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke demonstrates edge case testing and boundary condition bugs through an escalating narrative, where each order represents a different type of invalid input that QA should test, culminating in a system crash - perfectly capturing why debugging is necessary.

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
  explanation: This is the ultimate debugging humor piece - it perfectly captures how thorough testing can miss the most obvious use cases, showing that no matter how much debugging and testing you do, users will always find a way to break things in ways you never imagined. The escalation from methodical testing to catastrophic failure is both absurd and painfully accurate.
