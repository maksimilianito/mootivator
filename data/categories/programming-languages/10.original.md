- text: "Python is named after Monty Python, which explains why it's the only language where 'import antigravity' is considered documentation."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Python's quirky Easter eggs and its connection to Monty Python's absurdist humor, suggesting the language inherited its comedic nature from its namesake."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C#!"
  explanation: "A simple pun combining the physical inability to see with the programming language C#, playing on JavaScript developers' stereotypical focus on their own language."

- text: "Assembly language: where 'Hello World' is a weekend project."
  explanation: "This highlights the verbosity and complexity of low-level programming by contrasting it with the traditionally simple first program every programmer writes."

- text: "I tried to learn Rust, but I kept getting ownership errors in my brain."
  explanation: "This applies Rust's famously strict ownership system (which causes many compiler errors) to the human learning process itself, creating an unexpected parallel."

- text: "PHP: the language that keeps working long after you've given up understanding why."
  explanation: "This references PHP's reputation for quirky behavior and inconsistencies that somehow still produce functioning websites despite confusing developers."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "A classic setup-punchline joke using SQL's JOIN operation in a social context, with the double meaning of joining tables versus joining people at a bar."

- text: "I told my friend I was learning Haskell. He asked if I was ready for the monad tutorial. I said, 'Maybe.' He replied, 'That's the spirit!'"
  explanation: "This is a layered joke where 'Maybe' is both a casual response and a reference to Haskell's Maybe monad, one of the most confusing concepts for beginners."

- text: "Java: write once, debug everywhere."
  explanation: "A twist on Java's famous motto 'write once, run anywhere,' this reflects the reality that cross-platform compatibility doesn't eliminate bugs, it just distributes them."

- text: "Why do C programmers never die? They just get cast into void pointers."
  explanation: "This combines programming concepts (type casting and void pointers) with the idea of death and afterlife, suggesting C programmers exist in an undefined state."

- text: "My code doesn't work, I have no idea why. My code works, I have no idea why. Both are valid JavaScript."
  explanation: "This captures JavaScript's notorious type coercion and unpredictable behavior that can make both success and failure equally mysterious to developers."

- text: "COBOL programmers are the only people who can legitimately say their code is older than their coworkers."
  explanation: "This references COBOL's extreme longevity in production systems, where code written in the 1960s-80s is still running today, outliving multiple generations of programmers."

- text: "A programmer's partner asks: 'Could you go to the store and get a liter of milk? And if they have eggs, get twelve.' The programmer returns with 12 liters of milk and explains: 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "This classic joke demonstrates how programmers interpret conditional logic literally, treating 'if they have eggs' as a condition that modifies the quantity of milk rather than an additional item to purchase."

- text: "Perl: the only language where the code review consists of asking, 'Did you mean to write line noise?'"
  explanation: "This references Perl's reputation for extremely terse, symbol-heavy syntax that can look like random characters, especially in code golf or regex-heavy scripts."

- text: "Why did the Lisp programmer get lost in the forest? Too many parentheses to find the way out."
  explanation: "Lisp is famous for its extensive use of nested parentheses, and this joke creates an absurd scenario where this syntactic feature becomes a physical maze."

- text: "Go: a language designed by people who got tired of waiting for C++ to compile and decided to make that everyone else's problem by removing features."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated commentary on Go's design philosophy of simplicity through omission, suggesting that fast compilation came at the cost of features developers wanted."

- text: "A Kotlin developer and a Java developer walk into a bar. The Kotlin developer orders a beer?. The bartender is confused, but the beer magically appears anyway."
  explanation: "This references Kotlin's null-safety features with the '?' operator, creating an absurd scenario where uncertain ordering still produces results, mocking overly-safe type systems."

- text: "Why do functional programmers always carry maps? Because they refuse to change state and need to transform their location instead."
  explanation: "This applies functional programming's core principle of immutability to physical navigation, creating humor through the absurdity of never changing but always transforming."

- text: "I wrote a program in Brainfuck once. My therapist says I'm making good progress, but I still see angle brackets when I close my eyes."
  explanation: "Brainfuck is an intentionally minimalist and difficult esoteric language, and this joke treats programming in it as a traumatic experience requiring psychological recovery."

- text: "TypeScript: because JavaScript developers wanted to experience the joy of arguing with a compiler before their code runs, not just after."
  explanation: "This captures the philosophical shift from JavaScript's runtime flexibility to TypeScript's compile-time strictness, framing static typing as masochistic anticipation of errors."

- text: "A C++ programmer walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we're closed.' The programmer replies, 'But your destructor hasn't been called yet!' The bartender sighs, 'Fine, but this is the last time I'm letting you exploit my object lifetime.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke plays on C++'s complex object lifetime management and RAII principles, creating a scenario where a programmer literally exploits destructor timing to stay in a closing bar, paralleling resource management bugs."

- text: "Why did the Rust programmer refuse to go to the party? Because the borrow checker wouldn't let them have fun while their responsibilities were still in scope, and they couldn't figure out how to add the 'unsafe' keyword to their social life."
  explanation: "This is a multi-layered joke that parallels Rust's ownership system with social obligations, suggesting that Rust's safety guarantees have psychologically conditioned the programmer to apply borrow checking to real life, with 'unsafe' blocks representing social rule-breaking."
