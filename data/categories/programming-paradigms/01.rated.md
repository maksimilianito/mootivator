- text: "Functional programmers don't have side effects. They have 'unexpected features in the return value.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the core principle of functional programming (avoiding side effects) while using the classic programmer excuse of calling bugs 'features.' It's a gentle introduction that establishes the paradigm comparison theme."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the object-oriented programmer refuse to go to the beach? Too many public members exposed."
  explanation: "A simple pun on OOP's access modifiers (public/private) applied to a beach scenario. The double meaning of 'public members' creates mild incongruity between programming concepts and social situations."
  rating: 5

- text: "Procedural programming: Do this, then do that. Object-oriented programming: Ask someone else to do it."
  explanation: "This contrasts the imperative nature of procedural programming with OOP's message-passing philosophy. The humor comes from reducing OOP to simple delegation, which is both accurate and reductive."
  rating: 7

- text: "A functional programmer walks into a bar. The bar remains unchanged."
  explanation: "This joke relies on understanding immutability in functional programming - the core principle that data structures don't change. The setup uses the classic 'walks into a bar' format but subverts expectations by emphasizing state preservation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Object-oriented code: Where your problems inherit from their parents' problems."
  explanation: "A clever play on OOP inheritance that applies it to psychological family dynamics. The technical concept of inheritance is reframed as generational trauma, creating humor through unexpected context switching."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do functional programmers prefer maps over loops? Because they refuse to change their state of mind."
  explanation: "This combines the functional programming concept of immutability (unchanging state) with the idiom 'state of mind,' while contrasting map operations with imperative loops."
  rating: 7

- text: "In object-oriented programming, every problem looks like a nail when all you have is a factory pattern."
  explanation: "A twist on 'when all you have is a hammer' that satirizes OOP's tendency toward over-engineering with design patterns, specifically mocking the often-overused factory pattern."
  rating: 8

- text: "Declarative programmer's diary: 'Today I described what I wanted. Still waiting for it to happen.'"
  explanation: "This highlights the philosophical difference between declarative (what) and imperative (how) programming by applying it to real life, where describing desires doesn't make them automatically happen."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the aspect-oriented programmer get fired? He kept cutting across everyone's concerns."
  explanation: "A pun on AOP's 'cross-cutting concerns' applied to workplace behavior. The technical term becomes a description of rude social behavior, creating humor through the double meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "A logic programmer walked into a bar. Or did the bar walk into them? The answer is yes."
  explanation: "This joke plays with logic programming's relationship with formal logic and unification, where questions might have unexpected answers like 'yes' to an or-question, violating normal conversational expectations."
  rating: 8

- text: "Object-oriented pizza delivery: The pizza knows how to deliver itself, but first it needs to inherit from Food, implement Deliverable, and instantiate a DeliveryStrategy."
  explanation: "This satirizes OOP's complexity and over-abstraction by applying it to a simple task. The humor comes from the absurd overhead required for something straightforward, highlighting a real criticism of OOP."
  rating: 9

- text: "Functional programming is like mathematics. Object-oriented programming is like high school drama - everyone's got relationships and they're all complicated."
  explanation: "This uses a comparison to non-programming contexts (math vs. drama) to characterize the paradigms. The 'relationships' pun refers both to OOP object relationships and interpersonal drama."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't procedural programmers ever get lost? Because they follow GOTO statements. Wait, that's exactly why they get lost."
  explanation: "A self-correcting joke that first suggests procedural programming's directness, then acknowledges the infamous problems with GOTO statements, creating humor through immediate contradiction."
  rating: 7

- text: "Event-driven programmer's love life: Still waiting for the right callback."
  explanation: "Applies the event-driven programming concept of callbacks to dating, where 'callback' becomes both a technical term and a metaphor for someone calling you back romantically."
  rating: 6

- text: "A reactive programmer and an imperative programmer walk into a bar. The reactive programmer is already drunk because he subscribed to the beer stream."
  explanation: "This contrasts reactive programming's push-based model with imperative programming's pull-based model, using the setup of reactive streams to create a temporal paradox for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "Object-oriented programming: Encapsulating your bugs so thoroughly that even you can't find them."
  explanation: "A satirical take on OOP's encapsulation principle, suggesting that information hiding can be too effective. The joke acknowledges a real frustration with debugging in heavily abstracted OOP systems."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the functional programmer bring a ladder to the bar? To reach higher-order functions."
  explanation: "A pun combining the physical concept of 'higher' with the programming concept of 'higher-order functions,' creating a visual absurdity while demonstrating understanding of functional programming terminology."
  rating: 5

- text: "Imperative programming: 'Do this! Now do that!' Functional programming: 'Here's a recipe.' Reactive programming: 'I'll let you know when something happens.' Logic programming: 'I'll figure out how to make it true.'"
  explanation: "This comprehensive comparison uses everyday analogies to characterize four paradigms, with each description capturing the essential philosophy while building to the most abstract (logic programming)."
  rating: 9

- text: "An object-oriented programmer's worst nightmare: Multiple inheritance from their spouse's family and their own family, with conflicting method implementations for every holiday."
  explanation: "This applies the diamond problem (a famous multiple inheritance issue) to family dynamics during holidays, where conflicting expectations create chaos. The technical accuracy combined with relatable social situations creates strong humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the functional programmer refuse therapy? The therapist kept trying to change their state, but they were immutable."
  explanation: "The deepest joke, playing on immutability as both a technical concept and a personality trait. It works on multiple levels: the technical accuracy, the psychological implication, and the absurdity of applying programming paradigms to mental health."
  rating: 9

- text: "A Haskell programmer, a Java programmer, and a C programmer walk into a bar. The Haskell programmer describes the perfect bar. The Java programmer builds an AbstractBarFactoryFactory. The C programmer segfaults before reaching the door."
  explanation: "This masterfully combines paradigm stereotypes: functional programming's idealism, OOP's over-engineering, and procedural programming's danger. Each characterization is technically accurate while building to an absurd crescendo, making it the culmination of paradigm humor."
