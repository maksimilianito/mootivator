- text: "My IoT doorbell has 2KB of RAM. It can either remember who rang or play the chime, but not both."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the severe memory constraints of embedded systems. The absurd limitation that a device can't do two simple tasks simultaneously highlights the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices, where every byte of RAM matters."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the microcontroller go to therapy? It had too many unresolved interrupts."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'interrupts' (a technical feature of microcontrollers that pauses execution) and psychological 'unresolved issues.' The anthropomorphization of the microcontroller creates incongruity between technical and emotional concepts."
  rating: 7

- text: "Embedded systems: where malloc() is a four-letter word."
  explanation: "This references the taboo nature of dynamic memory allocation in embedded systems due to limited resources and unpredictability. The joke plays on the phrase 'four-letter word' meaning profanity, though malloc is actually six letters, adding another layer of humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "I optimized my code from 2KB to 1.9KB. My manager wants to know why I took three weeks."
  explanation: "This highlights the painstaking nature of embedded development where saving even 100 bytes is significant work, contrasted with management's lack of understanding of the technical challenges involved."
  rating: 8

- text: "Real programmers don't need an operating system. They toggle the bits directly with a magnet."
  explanation: "This is an extreme exaggeration of bare-metal embedded programming, referencing the old practice of using magnetic core memory while mocking the 'real programmers' gatekeeping mentality."
  rating: 7

- text: "My smart fridge runs Linux. It crashes more often than it defrosts."
  explanation: "This satirizes the trend of putting full operating systems on IoT devices that don't need them, resulting in reliability issues. The incongruity is that a simple appliance becomes less reliable when made 'smart.'"
  rating: 8

- text: "How many embedded engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just redefine darkness as the standard."
  explanation: "This plays on the embedded systems practice of working around limitations rather than solving them directly, often by redefining requirements or accepting constraints as features."
  rating: 9

- text: "I spent six hours debugging. Turns out I had the oscillator frequency wrong. Everything was running at half speed, including my sanity."
  explanation: "Clock configuration is a common source of subtle bugs in embedded systems. The joke extends the 'half speed' to the programmer's mental state, creating a relatable emotional connection."
  rating: 7

- text: "IoT stands for 'Insufficient on Tuesdays.'"
  explanation: "This is a cynical redefinition playing on the unreliability of IoT devices and the arbitrary nature of their failures. It also mocks the tendency to create acronyms for everything in tech."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't microcontrollers ever win arguments? They always get stuck in infinite loops."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes microcontrollers and uses the technical concept of infinite loops (a common bug) as a metaphor for being unable to progress in an argument."
  rating: 6

- text: "My embedded system is so resource-constrained, I had to choose between error handling and actually working."
  explanation: "This highlights the painful trade-offs in embedded development where even basic software engineering practices must be sacrificed for size constraints, with the absurd implication that functionality itself becomes optional."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote a Hello World program for an ATtiny. It took 90% of the flash memory. The other 10% is for regret."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the limited storage of tiny microcontrollers while adding a meta-commentary about the developer's emotional state, creating humor through both technical accuracy and emotional relatability."
  rating: 8

- text: "Embedded developer's prayer: 'Dear God, please let this be a hardware problem.'"
  explanation: "This inverts the usual developer preference (software bugs are easier to fix than hardware issues), reflecting the unique challenges of embedded systems where debugging hardware-software interactions is particularly difficult."
  rating: 7

- text: "My smart toaster has a buffer overflow vulnerability. Now it makes toast AND bitcoin."
  explanation: "This combines security concerns in IoT devices with the absurdity of cryptocurrency mining on a toaster, creating humor through the ridiculous juxtaposition of mundane appliances and cybersecurity exploits."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the embedded engineer refuse to use floats? He said they were too 'expensive.' He was talking about CPU cycles, not money. Or was he?"
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'expensive' in embedded contexts (computational cost) versus actual cost, with the ambiguity suggesting embedded engineers are so cost-conscious the meanings blur together."
  rating: 7

- text: "I connected my IoT devices to the cloud. Now my house has 99.9% uptime, which means it's uninhabitable for 8.76 hours per year."
  explanation: "This applies cloud computing SLA metrics to home automation with absurd literalism, highlighting how reliability percentages that sound good become problematic when applied to physical spaces we inhabit."
  rating: 9

- text: "In embedded systems, 'undefined behavior' isn't a bug—it's job security."
  explanation: "This darkly humorous take on the unpredictability of low-level programming suggests that the difficulty of embedded development is what keeps engineers employed, with a cynical twist on professional incentives."
  rating: 8

- text: "My microcontroller has 32 bytes of RAM. I use 30 for the stack, 1 for the program counter, and 1 for crying."
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdly precise memory allocation including an emotional category, highlighting extreme resource constraints while anthropomorphizing the development experience through the 'crying' byte."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my Arduino why it kept resetting. It said, 'Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?'"
  explanation: "This reverses the classic IT support advice, having the device suggest the human needs rebooting. It plays on the frustration of mysterious resets while creating incongruity through role reversal."
  rating: 7

- text: "Embedded systems: where commenting your code means you're over budget."
  explanation: "This exaggerates memory constraints to the absurd point where even comments (which don't compile into the binary) feel like a luxury, satirizing the extreme optimization mindset of embedded developers."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally got my IoT sensor network working perfectly. Then I remembered: I was supposed to measure temperature, not my own blood pressure."
  explanation: "This creates humor through misdirection—the 'perfect' system is actually measuring the wrong thing (the developer's stress-induced blood pressure), commenting on both the difficulty of embedded development and the tendency to lose sight of original requirements."
