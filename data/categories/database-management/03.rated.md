- text: "My database administrator said he's good at relationships. He wasn't talking about dating."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'relationships' - in databases, relationships are connections between tables, while in everyday language it refers to personal connections. The humor comes from the misdirection where we initially think he's talking about romantic relationships, then realize he means database relationships."

- text: "Why did the SQL query go to therapy? It had too many inner join issues."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'INNER JOIN' (a SQL operation that combines rows from two tables) and 'inner join issues' which sounds like 'inner joint issues' or psychological problems. The joke anthropomorphizes the SQL query and applies database terminology to mental health."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my database it was being too rigid. It said it was just maintaining its integrity."
  explanation: "This plays on 'data integrity' (a database principle ensuring accuracy and consistency) and personal integrity (moral principles). The humor comes from the database defending its strictness as a virtue using technical terminology that also has human meaning."
  rating: 8

- text: "My database backup walked out on me. I should have seen it coming - it was always distant."
  explanation: "This joke uses 'distant' to refer to off-site or remote backups while also suggesting emotional distance in a relationship. It personifies the backup as a romantic partner who leaves, creating humor through the unexpected application of relationship dynamics to data management."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? They always show their indexes."
  explanation: "This plays on 'showing your hand' in poker (revealing your cards) and database indexes (structures that improve query performance). The joke suggests databases are bad at bluffing because indexes make data too easily accessible."

- text: "A DBA walks into a bar, sees two tables, and immediately tries to join them."
  explanation: "This uses the physical setup of a bar with literal tables and the SQL JOIN operation. The humor comes from a DBA's professional instinct to join database tables being applied inappropriately to furniture in a social setting."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my database for a date. It returned NULL."
  explanation: "NULL in databases represents the absence of a value. The joke applies this technical concept to romantic rejection - the database literally returns 'nothing' when asked for a date, which is both technically accurate and humorously brutal."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the NoSQL database break up with SQL? It needed more flexibility in the relationship."
  explanation: "This references the fundamental difference between SQL (structured, rigid schema) and NoSQL (flexible, schema-less) databases, framing it as a relationship incompatibility. The humor comes from applying database architecture philosophy to romantic relationship dynamics."
  rating: 8

- text: "My database said I was too clingy. Apparently checking on it every millisecond counts as 'excessive polling.'"
  explanation: "Database polling is when you repeatedly check for updates. The joke equates this technical practice with clingy relationship behavior, where constantly checking on someone is considered unhealthy, creating humor through the parallel between technical and personal boundaries."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the database administrator always calm? He knew how to handle transactions under pressure."
  explanation: "Database transactions are operations that must be completed fully or not at all. The joke plays on 'handling transactions' (technical) and 'handling pressure' (emotional), suggesting that database skills translate to life skills."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to normalize my database, but it said it was happy being a little denormalized. Sometimes you need redundancy for performance."
  explanation: "Normalization eliminates redundancy in databases, while denormalization intentionally adds it for speed. The joke anthropomorphizes the database as preferring its 'flaws' for practical reasons, paralleling how people might embrace their imperfections."
  rating: 7

- text: "A database walks into a bar and splits into two tables. The bartender says, 'Is this a partition?' The database replies, 'No, we're just separating for performance reasons.'"
  explanation: "Database partitioning splits tables for better performance. The joke frames this as a relationship separation, with the database clarifying it's technical optimization rather than emotional incompatibility, using relationship counseling language for database operations."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the MongoDB refuse to commit? It said it wasn't ready for ACID relationships."
  explanation: "ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are properties of traditional SQL databases. MongoDB historically had weaker ACID guarantees. The joke frames this as commitment issues, with 'ACID relationships' sounding like serious, stable partnerships."
  rating: 9

- text: "My database crashed at the worst time. I should have known - it had been logging errors about our relationship for weeks."
  explanation: "Database logs record errors and events. The joke suggests the database was documenting relationship problems before the final 'crash' (failure), paralleling how relationship issues often have warning signs that are ignored."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't database administrators like surprises? Because unexpected behavior should always be caught by exception handling."
  explanation: "Exception handling in databases manages errors gracefully. The joke applies this professional preference for predictability to personal life, suggesting DBAs want to 'catch' and handle all surprises programmatically."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my database to forget my ex. It said, 'DELETE is permanent, but are you sure you don't want to just UPDATE the status to inactive?'"
  explanation: "This contrasts DELETE (permanent removal) with UPDATE (modification) operations, framing the database as giving relationship advice about whether to completely remove someone from your life or just change their status, showing unexpected wisdom from a technical system."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why was the database administrator great at parties? He knew exactly how to optimize social queries and cache popular conversations."
  explanation: "Query optimization and caching are performance techniques in databases. The joke suggests these technical skills translate to social situations - finding information efficiently and remembering frequently accessed topics, making database expertise unexpectedly useful for socializing."
  rating: 7

- text: "My database said we needed to talk about our schema. I said, 'What's wrong with our structure?' It replied, 'You keep trying to force me into relationships I wasn't designed for.'"
  explanation: "Database schemas define structure and relationships. The joke frames a technical discussion about database design as relationship counseling, where forcing incompatible relationships causes problems in both databases and personal life, with the database advocating for respecting its original design."
  rating: 8

- text: "A junior developer asked the senior DBA, 'How do you keep your database relationships healthy?' The DBA replied, 'Foreign keys, proper indexing, and never, ever cascade delete without thinking it through.'"
  explanation: "This joke layers technical advice (foreign keys maintain referential integrity, indexes improve performance, CASCADE DELETE removes related records) with relationship wisdom. The punchline about cascade delete parallels the irreversible consequences of rash decisions in relationships."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the distributed database have trust issues? Because eventual consistency means you never know if everyone has the same story right now."
  explanation: "Eventual consistency in distributed databases means data synchronizes over time, not instantly. The joke brilliantly parallels this with trust issues in relationships where information asymmetry and delayed communication create uncertainty about whether everyone is on the same page."
  rating: 10

- text: "I told my database I needed space. It responded, 'I've allocated 500GB for you, but if you mean emotional space, that's not in my schema.' Then it ran VACUUM and defragmented itself anyway."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke plays on 'space' (storage vs. emotional distance), shows the database's literal interpretation of human needs, and ends with it running VACUUM (a cleanup operation) anyway - suggesting even databases understand that sometimes you need to clean up and reorganize after relationship discussions, even if they don't fully understand the emotional context."
