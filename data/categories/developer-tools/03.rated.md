- text: My debugger has trust issues—it always wants to step through everything I do.
  explanation: This joke uses personification to give the debugger human emotions. The humor comes from the double meaning of "trust issues" and "step through"—debuggers literally step through code line by line, but it's framed as if the tool doesn't trust the programmer to do things correctly, mirroring human relationship dynamics.

- text: Why did the profiler go to therapy? It had too many performance issues.
  explanation: This is a classic setup-punchline joke using double meaning. "Performance issues" works both as a technical term (what profilers measure) and as a psychological/personal problem, creating incongruity between the technical and human contexts.

- text: The linter and I have different opinions about what constitutes a "problem."
  explanation: This joke plays on the common frustration developers have with linters flagging code that technically works. The humor lies in the understated conflict between human judgment and automated tool strictness, using personification to frame it as a difference of opinion.

- text: My IDE autocomplete finishes my sentences like an overeager friend who thinks they know what I'm going to say.
  explanation: This uses analogy to compare IDE autocomplete to an annoying social behavior. The incongruity comes from applying social dynamics to a programming tool, and the humor resonates because autocomplete often suggests the wrong thing at the wrong time.

- text: Version control systems are just elaborate ways of saying "I told you so" to your past self.
  explanation: This aphorism reframes the purpose of version control through a humorous lens. The superiority theory applies here—we laugh at our past mistakes. The insight that version control serves as evidence of previous decisions adds philosophical depth to a technical tool.

- text: Why don't developers trust their memory profilers? Because they have a history of leaking information.
  explanation: This joke uses wordplay with "leaking"—memory profilers detect memory leaks, but the punchline frames it as if the profiler itself leaks (reveals) information, playing on the double meaning of "leak" and adding "history" to create a trust narrative.
  rating: 7

- text: My code coverage tool judges me harder than my actual code reviewers.
  explanation: This joke uses comparison and exaggeration to highlight how code coverage metrics can feel more critical than human feedback. The humor comes from personifying the tool as judgmental and suggesting automated metrics are harsher than people.
  rating: 7

- text: Debugging tools are like therapists—they help you understand why you're broken, but you still have to fix yourself.
  explanation: This extended analogy compares debugging to therapy, creating humor through the parallel between psychological and technical problem-solving. The insight that understanding doesn't equal fixing adds depth while maintaining relatability.
  rating: 9

- text: What's a developer's favorite magic trick? Making breakpoints disappear when someone else is watching.
  explanation: This joke plays on the common experience of bugs that only appear when you're alone. The "magic trick" framing adds whimsy, and the specific mention of breakpoints (a debugging tool) grounds it in the category while highlighting the frustrating phenomenon.
  rating: 8

- text: My static analyzer is so strict, it flags my comments for being too optimistic.
  explanation: This joke uses absurdist humor and exaggeration. Static analyzers check code, not comments, making this technically impossible—but the humor works because it captures how overly strict these tools can feel, extending their pickiness to ridiculous extremes.
  rating: 8

- text: Git blame is the only tool that makes you nostalgic for your bugs—at least back then, they were someone else's problem.
  explanation: This joke plays with the git blame tool's purpose (finding who wrote problematic code) and adds a twist of dark humor about workplace responsibility. The incongruity between nostalgia and bugs creates the humor, with a cynical observation about blame culture.
  rating: 9

- text: Why did the developer break up with their debugger? It kept bringing up old issues they'd already resolved.
  explanation: This uses relationship metaphor to describe technical frustration. The double meaning of "bringing up old issues" works both for relationship conflicts and for debuggers that surface previously fixed bugs or edge cases, creating layered humor.
  rating: 8

- text: Profilers are just performance reviews for code that can't argue back or make excuses.
  explanation: This aphorism draws a parallel between workplace performance reviews and code profiling. The humor comes from the superiority angle—code can't defend itself—while also poking fun at how humans make excuses during reviews.
  rating: 8

- text: My code formatter and I are in a passive-aggressive war over where semicolons belong.
  explanation: This personifies the formatter as having opinions and being in conflict with the developer. The "passive-aggressive" characterization is particularly funny because formatters just silently change your code, which mirrors that specific type of human conflict behavior.
  rating: 9

- text: What do you call a developer who doesn't use developer tools? A masochist with excellent memory.
  explanation: This joke uses exaggeration and absurdity to emphasize how essential developer tools are. The humor comes from the extreme characterization and the impossible suggestion that someone could effectively develop without tools, requiring superhuman memory.
  rating: 7

- text: Stack traces are like crime scene investigations where you're both the detective and the murderer.
  explanation: This metaphor creates dark humor by comparing debugging to solving a murder mystery. The twist that you're both roles creates a self-deprecating loop that resonates with developers who debug their own code, using incongruity for effect.

- text: Why did the heap dump go to the psychiatrist? It couldn't stop dwelling on the past and needed help with garbage collection.
  explanation: This sophisticated joke layers multiple meanings—heap dumps analyze memory, "dwelling on the past" describes both memory retention and psychological rumination, and "garbage collection" works as both a technical term and a metaphor for letting go of mental baggage.
  rating: 9

- text: My test coverage report is like a report card that only shows the questions I didn't answer.
  explanation: This analogy reframes test coverage through an educational lens. The humor comes from the insight that coverage reports highlight gaps rather than successes, creating a pessimistic but relatable view of how we experience these metrics.
  rating: 8

- text: Continuous integration tools are just robots that judge your work every time you think you're done, ensuring you're never actually done.
  explanation: This joke captures the endless cycle of CI/CD pipelines. The humor comes from the existential observation about never being "done" combined with personifying CI tools as judgmental robots, creating both technical and philosophical comedy.
  rating: 8

- text: What's the difference between a debugger and a time machine? A time machine doesn't make you watch your mistakes in slow motion while highlighting each poor decision with a red arrow.
  explanation: This comparison joke uses vivid imagery to describe the debugging experience. The humor comes from the exaggerated description of debuggers as torture devices that force you to relive mistakes, combining technical accuracy with emotional truth.
  rating: 9

- text: My IDE's refactoring tool is like autocorrect for code—90% helpful, 10% actively trying to ruin my life by renaming variables to things like 'foo1' across 47 files.
  explanation: This joke uses specific percentages and concrete examples to create vivid humor. The comparison to autocorrect taps into universal frustration, while the specific scenario of mass-renaming to useless names captures a real fear developers have about automated refactoring going wrong.
