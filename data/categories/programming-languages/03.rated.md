- text: "Python is named after Monty Python, which explains why it's full of unexpected indentation."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'unexpected' - both referring to Monty Python's surreal comedy style and Python's strict indentation requirements that often surprise new programmers."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C#."
  explanation: "A simple pun using programming language names - 'see sharp' sounds like 'C#', creating a visual impairment joke that works on the double meaning of programming language names and actual vision."
  rating: 5

- text: "Assembly language: because sometimes you need to feel every bump in the road."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the metaphor of driving to describe the low-level nature of Assembly, where programmers must handle minute details that higher-level languages abstract away."
  rating: 8

- text: "I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it."
  explanation: "This plays on the UDP protocol's lack of delivery confirmation - unlike TCP, UDP doesn't verify if data packets arrive, mirroring how the listener might not 'get' the joke."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C."
  explanation: "A variation on language name puns, this time contrasting Java with C, using 'see' as the homophone. It's a simple setup-punchline structure playing on language naming conventions."
  rating: 4

- text: "Perl: Write once, read never."
  explanation: "This parodies Java's old motto 'Write once, run anywhere' while commenting on Perl's reputation for producing cryptic, hard-to-read code that even the original author struggles to understand later."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the programmer quit his job at the calendar factory? He wanted to take some time off."
  explanation: "A misdirection joke - the setup suggests a programming-related punchline, but delivers a straightforward play on words about time and calendars instead."
  rating: 3

- text: "In Python, whitespace is not just for readability - it's the law."
  explanation: "This joke highlights Python's unique enforcement of indentation as syntax rather than style, elevating what other languages treat as convention to the level of legal requirement."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke playing on OOP's 'inheritance' concept (where classes inherit properties from parent classes) and the traditional meaning of inheriting wealth from relatives."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do C++ programmers have to use manual memory management? Because they can't let go of the past."
  explanation: "This works on multiple levels - literally referencing C++'s manual memory deallocation requirements, while metaphorically suggesting C++ developers are nostalgic for older programming paradigms."
  rating: 8

- text: "Rust: where the compiler is your therapist, and every session is mandatory."
  explanation: "This personifies Rust's famously strict compiler that catches errors at compile-time, comparing it to mandatory therapy sessions - helpful but intensive and unavoidable."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a SQL JOIN operation, creating a social scenario that mirrors the technical operation of combining database tables."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the functional programmer get lost in the woods? He kept trying to avoid side effects and couldn't leave any trail markers."
  explanation: "This joke plays on functional programming's principle of avoiding side effects (changes to state outside the function), creating an absurd real-world scenario where this principle becomes a liability."
  rating: 8

- text: "COBOL: Still running your bank account since your grandparents opened it."
  explanation: "This is a gentle jab at COBOL's age and persistence in legacy banking systems, using temporal exaggeration to highlight how old yet critical the language remains in financial infrastructure."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't Haskell programmers ever get invited to parties? Because they keep insisting everything should be pure."
  explanation: "This plays on Haskell's emphasis on pure functions while creating a social scenario where 'pure' takes on its colloquial meaning of being overly strict or prudish."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer's spouse says, 'While you're at the store, buy some milk.' The programmer never returns."
  explanation: "This is a classic infinite loop joke - the instruction 'while you're at the store' creates a condition that remains true as long as they're shopping, causing an endless loop with no exit condition."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why is LISP so good at family therapy? Because it helps everyone deal with their nested parentheses... I mean, issues."
  explanation: "This joke combines LISP's notorious abundance of nested parentheses with the concept of nested psychological issues in families, using the correction format to emphasize the double meaning."
  rating: 8

- text: "TypeScript: Because JavaScript's 'undefined is not a function' error messages weren't specific enough for your anxiety."
  explanation: "This plays on TypeScript's purpose of adding type safety to JavaScript, framing it as a response to the anxiety-inducing vague error messages that plague JavaScript developers."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between Java and JavaScript? About the same as the difference between car and carpet - one will take you places, the other will just sit there and collect dirt until someone complains about it enough to clean it up."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor joke addresses the common confusion between the two differently-named languages while making a subtle dig at JavaScript's evolution being driven by community complaints and patches."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Brainfuck programmer go insane? Actually, that's not a joke - it's just causality."
  explanation: "This meta-joke plays on Brainfuck's intentionally minimalist and cryptic design, suggesting that programming in it doesn't just correlate with insanity but actually causes it, while breaking the fourth wall to acknowledge it's not really a joke."
  rating: 8

- text: "A C programmer, a C++ programmer, and a Rust programmer walk into a bar. The C programmer orders a beer and drinks it. The C++ programmer orders a beer, creates a custom glass class with inheritance from drinkware, overloads the drinking operator, and drinks it. The Rust programmer spends three hours explaining to the bartender why their ownership model for beverages is memory-safe, gets into a fight with the borrow checker about whether they can drink and hold the glass simultaneously, finally compiles their drink order, takes one sip, and declares it was worth it because there were zero runtime errors."
  explanation: "This elaborate narrative joke contrasts three language philosophies: C's simplicity and directness, C++'s tendency toward over-engineering with OOP features, and Rust's obsession with compile-time safety at the cost of development speed. The joke builds through escalating complexity, with the Rust punchline being the longest and most absurd, mirroring real experiences developers have with Rust's strict but ultimately beneficial compiler."
