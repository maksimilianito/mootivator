- text: "My first SQL query returned 0 rows. At least it was consistent."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the beginner's experience where getting no results is technically a success (the query ran without errors), but also a disappointment. The humor comes from finding a silver lining in failure through the technical concept of 'consistency.'"

- text: "Why did the database administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the higher-level joins."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'higher-level' which in databases refers to more complex join operations, but the setup suggests a physical interpretation, creating incongruity between the literal and technical meanings."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked my database for a date. It gave me a timestamp instead."
  explanation: "Double meaning humor where 'date' means both a romantic outing and a data type in SQL. The database's literal interpretation of the request creates the comedic misdirection."
  rating: 7

- text: "SELECT * FROM problems WHERE solution IS NOT NULL; -- 0 rows returned"
  explanation: "This self-documenting joke uses actual SQL syntax to express the universal programmer experience of having many problems but no solutions, with the comment showing the depressing result."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? They always show their INNER JOINs."
  explanation: "Plays on the poker term 'show your hand' and the SQL concept of INNER JOIN, suggesting databases are too transparent about their relationships to be good at bluffing."
  rating: 6

- text: "My query was so slow, the database asked if I wanted to ORDER BY carrier pigeon."
  explanation: "Exaggerates query performance issues by suggesting even physical mail delivery would be faster, while cleverly incorporating the SQL keyword ORDER BY into the punchline."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a database's favorite exercise? Table scans. They're exhausting."
  explanation: "Double meaning on 'exhausting' - table scans are resource-intensive operations that examine every row, making them literally exhausting for the database and figuratively exhausting for DBAs who want to avoid them."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to DROP my problems, but I forgot the CASCADE option."
  explanation: "Uses SQL's DROP TABLE syntax where CASCADE automatically removes dependent objects. The joke suggests problems have dependencies just like database objects, and you need the right option to truly eliminate them."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the SQL query cold? It had too many LEFT OUTER JOINs and not enough INNER warmth."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes SQL joins, playing on 'outer' (cold, distant) versus 'inner' (warm, close) to create a metaphor about emotional distance using technical terminology."
  rating: 7

- text: "My database relationship status: It's complicated. Specifically, many-to-many with no proper junction table."
  explanation: "Applies database relationship modeling to personal relationships. A many-to-many relationship without a junction table is a database design flaw, mirroring complicated human relationships without clear boundaries."
  rating: 8

- text: "SELECT happiness FROM life WHERE coffee IS NOT NULL AND bugs = 0; -- Query timeout after 30 seconds"
  explanation: "Combines SQL syntax with programmer life commentary. The query times out because the WHERE conditions (having coffee AND zero bugs) create an impossible scenario, hence no results can ever be found."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the query go to therapy? It had abandonment issues after being orphaned by a failed transaction."
  explanation: "Uses database terminology (orphaned records, failed transactions) to create a psychological narrative. Orphaned records are a real database problem given human emotional context."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying my queries are slow, but my database just sent me a 'Still thinking...' emoji."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor anthropomorphizing the database as if it's a messaging app. The exaggeration highlights the frustration of slow query performance through an impossible but relatable scenario."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a query that returns exactly what you need on the first try? A hallucination."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about the iterative nature of query development. References the AI concept of 'hallucination' to suggest that perfect first-attempt queries are as real as AI-generated false information."
  rating: 8

- text: "My boss asked me to make the database faster. So I changed the timeout setting to 1 second. Problem solved!"
  explanation: "Malicious compliance humor where the technical solution (reducing timeout) makes queries fail faster rather than run faster. It's technically 'faster' but completely defeats the purpose."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't databases ever gossip? Because what happens in a transaction, stays in a transaction... unless you COMMIT."
  explanation: "Parodies 'What happens in Vegas' while explaining transaction isolation. The punchline with COMMIT reveals that database 'secrets' are actually designed to be shared, inverting the setup's implication."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a query so complex, the execution plan filed for disability benefits."
  explanation: "Absurdist personification where the query's execution plan (a database's roadmap for running a query) is so convoluted it's treated as an overworked employee seeking compensation for injury."
  rating: 8

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- Error: Column 'clue' does not exist"
  explanation: "Meta-humor suggesting users lack the 'clue' attribute entirely. The SQL error message becomes the punchline, implying the database can't even find the concept of users having a clue."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the DBA break up with their significant other? They said 'I need my space,' but the DBA heard 'I need my TABLESPACE' and got excited about database optimization."
  explanation: "Misdirection humor where the DBA misinterprets an emotional statement as technical jargon. TABLESPACE is actual database terminology, showing how technical thinking can interfere with personal relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "My query walked into a bar, ordered a JOIN, and left with three tables it didn't come in with. The bartender said, 'That's a CROSS JOIN for you.'"
  explanation: "Story-format joke using the 'walks into a bar' structure. CROSS JOIN creates a Cartesian product, multiplying rows unexpectedly - the query gets more than it bargained for, like someone who goes home with unexpected company."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally achieved query enlightenment: I realized that NULL is not zero, not empty, not false - it's the database's way of saying 'I plead the fifth.' And just like in court, comparing anything to it returns UNKNOWN, because NULL has a really good lawyer."
  explanation: "Philosophical humor that explains the tricky concept of NULL through legal metaphor. NULL's three-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN) is compared to legal protection against self-incrimination, making a complex technical concept both funny and memorable through extended metaphor."
