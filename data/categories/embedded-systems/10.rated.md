- text: "My IoT thermostat has 512 bytes of RAM. It's not smart, it's just opinionated."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the 'smart home' marketing term versus the reality of extremely limited memory in embedded systems. With only 512 bytes, the device can barely store data, let alone make intelligent decisions—it's just following rigid programming."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the embedded developer break up with their partner? Too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'dependencies'—both technical (libraries and modules required for code) and personal (emotional reliance). Embedded systems are notorious for complex dependency management in resource-constrained environments."
  rating: 7

- text: "Embedded systems: where 'Hello World' takes 3 weeks and 47 datasheets."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the complexity of embedded development compared to high-level programming. Even simple tasks require deep hardware knowledge, reading extensive technical documentation, and dealing with low-level configurations."
  rating: 9

- text: "My microcontroller has 2KB of flash memory. I call it 'minimalist' because 'insufficient' sounds unprofessional."
  explanation: "This joke uses euphemism humor, reframing a severe hardware limitation as a design philosophy. It reflects how embedded developers must constantly justify working within extreme constraints."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's an embedded programmer's favorite exercise? Stack overflow prevention."
  explanation: "A play on words combining the physical exercise concept with the very real danger in embedded systems where limited RAM makes stack overflows catastrophic. Unlike desktop systems, there's no safety net."
  rating: 6

- text: "I optimized my code from 2049 bytes to 2048 bytes. Now it fits in memory. I am a god."
  explanation: "This captures the absurd precision required in embedded development where a single byte can mean the difference between working code and complete failure. The dramatic self-aggrandizement contrasts humorously with the tiny achievement."
  rating: 9

- text: "IoT stands for 'Insufficient on Transistors.'"
  explanation: "A backronym that redefines IoT (Internet of Things) to highlight the resource constraints of embedded devices. It's a play on how IoT devices are perpetually underpowered for their ambitious goals."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't embedded systems tell jokes? They don't have enough memory for the punchline."
  explanation: "This is meta-humor that uses the very limitation being joked about as the reason the joke can't exist. It's self-referential while highlighting the memory constraints that define embedded development."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code uses 99.8% of available flash. I live on the edge. Literally."
  explanation: "This combines the figurative expression 'living on the edge' (taking risks) with the literal reality of using nearly all available storage. It captures the constant pressure of embedded development constraints."
  rating: 7

- text: "How many embedded developers does it take to change a light bulb? Three: one to write the driver, one to debug the I2C communication, and one to explain why it needs 6 AA batteries."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic light bulb joke format to highlight embedded systems complexity—even simple tasks require low-level hardware interfacing, communication protocols, and power management considerations."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Because that's where the hardware is."
  explanation: "This adapts the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format to embedded reality—unlike software development with multiple environments, embedded systems often have limited or expensive hardware, forcing production testing."
  rating: 9

- text: "Real-time operating system: where 'real-time' means 'maybe in 50 microseconds if nothing else interrupts.'"
  explanation: "This jokes about the gap between RTOS marketing promises and reality. True hard real-time guarantees are difficult, and embedded systems face constant interrupt challenges that affect timing."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why was the microcontroller cold? It was running in low-power mode."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'cold' as both temperature and inactive/sleeping. Low-power modes are essential in battery-operated embedded devices, where the processor literally reduces activity and heat generation."
  rating: 5

- text: "Embedded developer's prayer: 'Please let it be a hardware problem. Please let it be a hardware problem.' *It's always a hardware problem.*"
  explanation: "This captures the unique pain of embedded development where hardware and software are inseparable. The ironic twist is that getting your wish (hardware problem) doesn't actually help—it's often harder to fix."
  rating: 8

- text: "My smart doorbell has less computing power than a 1980s calculator, but it can somehow stream video to the cloud. I'm not saying it's magic, but I'm not not saying it's magic."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurd contradiction in IoT devices—they accomplish impressive feats with laughably limited resources. The double-negative construction emphasizes the developer's genuine bewilderment at making it work."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between an embedded system and a desktop application? About 16,777,000 bytes of RAM and all of your sanity."
  explanation: "This quantifies the resource gap (roughly 16MB, a tiny amount for desktops but massive for embedded) while adding the psychological toll. The precision of the number contrasts humorously with the vague 'all of your sanity.'"
  rating: 9

- text: "I spent 6 hours optimizing a loop to save 12 clock cycles. My therapist says this is 'concerning.' My microcontroller says it's 'essential.'"
  explanation: "This contrasts normal human perspective with embedded development reality. What seems like obsessive behavior is actually necessary optimization in resource-constrained systems. The personification of the microcontroller adds absurdist humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the embedded programmer refuse to use malloc()? Because in embedded systems, dynamic memory allocation is just static memory allocation with extra steps and existential dread."
  explanation: "This references the Rick and Morty meme format while making a serious point—dynamic allocation in embedded systems is dangerous due to fragmentation and unpredictability, making it essentially a worse version of static allocation."
  rating: 9

- text: "My IoT device has a race condition that only occurs on Tuesdays during leap years when Mercury is in retrograde. I've decided to call it a 'feature' and move on with my life."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the nightmare of embedded debugging—intermittent issues that are nearly impossible to reproduce. The astrological reference adds absurdity while the 'feature' rationalization is a relatable coping mechanism."
  rating: 9

- text: "Embedded systems: where you can choose any two of these three: fast, reliable, or fits in memory. Actually, scratch that—you get one. Maybe."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic project management triangle (fast/good/cheap) for embedded reality. The escalating pessimism from 'choose two' to 'you get one' to 'maybe' captures the brutal constraints perfectly."
  rating: 10

- text: "I wrote a function that was 3 bytes too large. So I rewrote it in assembly, sacrificed a goat to the silicon gods, and now it fits with 1 byte to spare. That byte is for my pride."
  explanation: "This escalates from normal optimization to ritual sacrifice, capturing the desperation and irrationality embedded developers feel. The final line about pride being stored in that single byte is both absurd and emotionally resonant—when you fight that hard for resources, every byte has meaning."
