- text: "Our CI/CD pipeline is so fast, it deploys bugs to production before QA can find them in staging."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and the incongruity theory - the speed that should be an advantage (fast CI/CD) becomes a disadvantage by enabling bugs to reach production faster. It plays on the common tension between deployment velocity and quality assurance."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the deployment fail? It worked on my machine."
  explanation: "A classic setup-punchline structure that references the infamous developer excuse. The humor comes from the disconnect between local development environments and production, a universal frustration in software deployment."
  rating: 6

- text: "Production is just staging with users watching."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses superiority theory and dark humor, suggesting a cavalier attitude toward deployment practices. It's funny because it exaggerates a real fear - that production environments aren't as stable as they should be."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A parody of the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, using incongruity to create humor. The joke is that testing in production is exactly what you shouldn't do, yet many developers have accidentally done it."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our rollback strategy is called 'panic and pray.'"
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that uses alliteration and the relief theory. It acknowledges the stressful reality that many teams don't have robust rollback procedures, making the anxiety relatable and therefore funny."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do deployments always fail at 5 PM on Friday? Because production has a sense of humor."
  explanation: "Personification of the production environment combined with Murphy's Law. The humor comes from the universal experience of late-week deployment disasters and the anthropomorphization of systems."
  rating: 7

- text: "Continuous deployment means continuously fixing what you just deployed."
  explanation: "A play on words that subverts the positive connotation of 'continuous deployment.' Uses incongruity theory by showing that automation can create continuous problems instead of continuous value."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer? The senior knows which deployments to do before vacation."
  explanation: "Superiority theory humor that highlights experience-based wisdom. The joke is that seniors have learned through painful experience never to deploy right before time off."
  rating: 7

- text: "My deployment script has two modes: doesn't work, and works but nobody knows why."
  explanation: "Binary humor that captures the mysterious nature of complex deployment systems. The absurdity comes from the fact that success without understanding is almost as problematic as failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "We practice infrastructure as code, which means our infrastructure breaks as reliably as our code."
  explanation: "Dark humor using the misdirection pattern. Sets up the expectation that infrastructure as code is an improvement, then reveals it just makes infrastructure failures as common as software bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the DevOps engineer bring a ladder to the deployment? To reach the high availability."
  explanation: "A pun-based joke using wordplay on 'high availability' as both a technical term and a physical concept. Simple setup-punchline structure with a groan-worthy dad-joke quality."
  rating: 4

- text: "Our blue-green deployment strategy is more like black-and-blue - something always gets hurt."
  explanation: "Color wordplay combined with physical injury metaphor. The humor comes from subverting the elegant concept of blue-green deployments with the reality of painful deployment experiences."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my manager we need zero-downtime deployments. He said we already have zero-downtime because our service is always down."
  explanation: "Logic paradox humor using the absurdity technique. The manager's response creates an unexpected twist where permanent downtime technically means no additional downtime during deployments."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call a deployment that goes perfectly? A myth, a legend, a story we tell junior developers to give them hope."
  explanation: "Escalating exaggeration that builds to a cynical punchline. Uses the relief theory by acknowledging the shared trauma of problematic deployments through storytelling metaphors."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our canary deployment died. Then the canary's canary died. Now we're deploying carrier pigeons."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that extends the canary metaphor to ridiculous lengths. The progression from canaries to carrier pigeons creates an image of increasingly desperate deployment strategies."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't deployment pipelines ever win at poker? Because they always show their hand in the logs."
  explanation: "Metaphorical humor comparing CI/CD transparency to poker strategy. The joke works on multiple levels - logs are essential but also expose everything that goes wrong."
  rating: 6

- text: "Deploying to production is easy. It's the staying employed afterward that's hard."
  explanation: "Dark humor with a two-part structure that sets up deployment as simple, then reveals the real challenge is dealing with the consequences. Uses misdirection and relief theory effectively."
  rating: 9

- text: "My Docker container is like my apartment - works fine until someone else has to enter it."
  explanation: "Relatable analogy humor comparing technical and personal life. The joke highlights the 'works on my machine' problem through a domestic metaphor, making it accessible and funny."
  rating: 8

- text: "We have a sophisticated deployment strategy: deploy fast, break things, blame microservices, repeat."
  explanation: "Satirical take on 'move fast and break things' culture with a cynical twist. The addition of 'blame microservices' adds a layer of commentary on how architecture complexity becomes a scapegoat."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the deployment engineer go to therapy? He had too many unresolved dependencies and commitment issues with his branches."
  explanation: "Psychology metaphor applied to technical concepts. Double-meaning humor where technical terms (dependencies, branches, commits) map perfectly to relationship therapy language, creating rich wordplay."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our release process is so mature, it has a midlife crisis every sprint and questions whether it should have gone into product management instead."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphization taken to absurd lengths with sophisticated meta-humor. The joke layers multiple concepts: process maturity, human aging, career regret, and the tension between engineering and product roles, creating humor through unexpected personification and relatable professional anxiety."
