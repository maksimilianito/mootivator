- text: "Documentation is like a love letter to your future self—except you never write it."
  explanation: "This joke uses the metaphor of a love letter to highlight the irony that developers know documentation is important for their future selves, yet they consistently fail to write it. The humor comes from the relatable gap between intention and action."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't developers write documentation? Because the code is self-explanatory... to them... six months ago."
  explanation: "This plays on the common excuse that 'code is self-documenting' while revealing the harsh truth that even the original author can't understand their own code after time passes. The escalating specificity adds to the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our API documentation is comprehensive—it comprehensively covers version 1.0, which we deprecated three years ago."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'comprehensive' to highlight a common problem where documentation becomes outdated. The misdirection from expecting complete coverage to realizing it's completely obsolete creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours debugging, then found the solution in the documentation. Good thing I didn't waste time reading it first!"
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and the superiority theory—the programmer feels clever for solving it themselves, not realizing they wasted time. It's self-deprecating humor about developer stubbornness."
  rating: 8

- text: "Documentation status: 'TODO: Write documentation.' Last updated: 847 days ago."
  explanation: "The absurdity comes from the meta-nature of documenting that you need to document, combined with the specific, long time period that shows complete abandonment of the task."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer write 500 pages of documentation? Because they were procrastinating on writing code."
  explanation: "This inverts the usual stereotype that developers avoid documentation, using incongruity theory to create humor through the unexpected reversal of typical developer behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "The documentation says 'See Figure 5.' There is no Figure 5. There never was."
  explanation: "This captures the frustrating experience of broken references in documentation. The finality of 'there never was' elevates it from a simple mistake to an existential statement about documentation quality."
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know a function is important? It has a comment that says '// TODO: Document this later.'"
  explanation: "This uses irony—the marker intended to remind someone to document actually becomes a permanent badge of undocumented code. The humor lies in the recognition of this universal pattern."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our documentation has 100% coverage—100% of it is copy-pasted from Stack Overflow."
  explanation: "This joke uses the misdirection pattern, starting with a positive metric (100% coverage) then revealing it's achieved through questionable means, highlighting a common but embarrassing practice."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the API documentation win an award? It was recognized as outstanding in its field—literally, it's been outstanding since 2015."
  explanation: "This uses a classic pun structure with 'outstanding' meaning both 'excellent' and 'still pending.' The specific year adds credibility and emphasizes the long delay."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote inline comments explaining why I couldn't write proper documentation. Now my code is well-documented with excuses."
  explanation: "This meta-humor joke shows someone documenting their failure to document, creating a paradox. It's relatable because many developers do leave apologetic comments in code."
  rating: 8

- text: "The best documentation is the kind that makes you feel stupid for not understanding it, then stupider when you realize it's wrong."
  explanation: "This captures the emotional journey of reading bad documentation—first self-doubt, then anger. The escalating levels of feeling stupid create the comedic progression."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't we need documentation? Because Bob wrote it, and Bob left the company, and Bob took all knowledge of what his documentation means with him."
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdist logic—the documentation exists but is useless without its creator, which defeats the entire purpose of documentation. The specific name 'Bob' makes it feel like a real scenario."
  rating: 7

- text: "I found a typo in the documentation. The whole thing—it shouldn't exist."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure with misdirection. We expect a small spelling error, but the 'typo' is the documentation's entire existence, suggesting the code is so bad it shouldn't exist."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our documentation follows the DRY principle: Don't Record Yourself."
  explanation: "This cleverly repurposes the well-known programming principle 'Don't Repeat Yourself' into an excuse for not documenting. The wordplay makes the familiar acronym work in a new, humorous context."
  rating: 9

- text: "How many developers does it take to write documentation? Unknown—the experiment is still running, but we've lost funding."
  explanation: "This parodies the classic 'how many does it take' joke format while suggesting documentation is such an impossible task that even a funded research project couldn't complete it."
  rating: 7

- text: "My documentation has excellent version control—it's permanently stuck at version 0.1 draft."
  explanation: "This uses irony where 'excellent version control' leads to the opposite result. The '0.1 draft' status suggests something barely started that never progressed, which is painfully relatable."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer print out the documentation? So they could say they've at least touched it."
  explanation: "This plays on the phrase 'touch' having both physical and metaphorical meanings. The absurdity of printing documentation just to claim minimal interaction highlights avoidance behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation for my code. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "This uses the classic 'it was all a dream' trope to suggest that well-documented code is literally a fantasy scenario. The brevity and simplicity make the joke land harder."
  rating: 8

- text: "The documentation said 'This function is deprecated.' The documentation was deprecated. Everything is deprecated. We're all deprecated now."
  explanation: "This escalates from a simple deprecation notice to an existential crisis, using repetition and expansion to create absurdist humor about the constant churn of software development."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why is our documentation like Schrödinger's cat? Until someone opens it, we can assume it's both accurate and completely wrong—but let's be honest, we know which one it is."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines quantum physics with software documentation, using the famous thought experiment as a metaphor. The final clause breaks the metaphor to acknowledge the harsh reality, creating humor through the collision of high-concept philosophy and mundane truth about documentation quality."
