- text: "QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity pattern by listing increasingly absurd test cases that QA engineers would actually run. It starts with normal inputs, then moves to edge cases (0, maximum values), then completely invalid inputs (lizard, negative numbers, random strings), mirroring the exhaustive nature of software testing. The humor comes from applying rigorous testing methodology to a simple social situation."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code works, but I don't know why. My tests pass, but I don't know why. At least I'm consistent."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke highlights the common developer experience of having both code and tests that work mysteriously. The punchline 'at least I'm consistent' uses irony - consistency in ignorance is not actually a virtue, creating humor through the relief theory by acknowledging a shared frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do testers make terrible comedians? They always find bugs in the punchline."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'bugs' and plays with the superiority theory by gently mocking testers' occupational habit of finding problems. The incongruity comes from applying software testing behavior to comedy, where finding 'bugs' in jokes would ruin the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Unit tests are like a good relationship: they should fail when something's actually wrong, not just to get attention."
  explanation: "This joke uses analogy humor, comparing flaky tests to attention-seeking behavior in relationships. It addresses the real problem of unreliable tests while using an unexpected comparison that creates incongruity between technical and personal domains."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous but common practice of insufficient testing. The humor comes from the bravado applied to what is actually terrible practice, using the superiority theory as we laugh at the foolishness."
  rating: 8

- text: "Software testing: where 'it works on my machine' meets 'prove it.'"
  explanation: "This aphorism captures the eternal conflict between developers and testers. The incongruity comes from the collision of the developer's subjective confidence with the tester's demand for objective evidence, a tension familiar to anyone in software development."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation."
  explanation: "This cynical joke suggests that the only difference between a bug and a feature is whether you wrote it down intentionally. It uses misdirection - we expect a technical distinction but get a commentary on how organizations justify problems through documentation."
  rating: 8

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. The bar immediately crashes because nobody tested what happens when a QA engineer walks in."
  explanation: "This meta-joke creates recursive humor by making the QA engineer's presence itself an untested edge case. It's absurdist humor that comments on the impossibility of testing everything, including the act of testing itself."
  rating: 9

- text: "My test coverage is like my diet: I claim it's 80%, but I'm really just avoiding the hard parts."
  explanation: "This uses analogy and self-deprecating humor to address the common practice of gaming coverage metrics by avoiding difficult-to-test code. The comparison to diet makes the technical concept relatable through a universal human experience of self-deception."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to write tests? He said his code was already 'exceptional' - it threw plenty of exceptions."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'exceptional' (meaning both excellent and throwing exceptions/errors). The misdirection leads us to expect praise for the code, but the punchline reveals it's actually buggy, inverting our expectations."
  rating: 7

- text: "Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs. So basically, we're professional pessimists with evidence."
  explanation: "This starts with Dijkstra's famous quote then adds a humorous self-deprecating characterization of testers. It acknowledges the philosophical limitation of testing while embracing it as an identity, using the relief theory to cope with an inherent limitation."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote a test that checks if other tests are working. Now I need a test for that test. Send help."
  explanation: "This joke explores the infinite regress problem in testing through absurdity. Who tests the tests? The recursive nature creates humor through the logical paradox, while also expressing a real anxiety about test reliability."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers hate writing tests? Because it's the only time they have to admit their code might be wrong before someone else proves it."
  explanation: "This psychological humor addresses the ego-based resistance to testing. The incongruity comes from framing testing as a pre-emptive admission of fallibility, which conflicts with developers' desire to appear competent."
  rating: 7

- text: "My tests are like my New Year's resolutions: well-intentioned, started with enthusiasm, and abandoned by February."
  explanation: "This analogy humor compares test maintenance to failed resolutions, acknowledging the common problem of test rot. The specific detail of 'February' makes it more concrete and relatable, while the self-deprecating tone creates sympathy."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a tester's favorite song? 'Break Stuff' by Limp Bizkit."
  explanation: "This cultural reference joke plays on testers' job being to literally break stuff. The unexpected connection between a nu-metal song and software testing creates incongruity, while the accuracy of the description makes it land."
  rating: 5

- text: "I told my manager we need more time for testing. He said, 'Just test the important parts.' I said, 'How will I know which parts are important without testing?' He's been rebooting for 10 minutes now."
  explanation: "This joke uses dialogue to build up a logical paradox, then adds an absurdist ending where the manager 'reboots' like a crashed computer. It addresses the real problem of inadequate testing time while using anthropomorphization for humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the test fail on Friday afternoon? Because even tests know when to give up."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes tests while commenting on the phenomenon of Friday deployments going wrong. The incongruity of tests having awareness of time and work-life balance creates humor through absurdity."
  rating: 6

- text: "A product manager, a developer, and a QA engineer walk into a bar. The QA engineer says, 'Did anyone verify this bar meets our requirements?' The developer says, 'It compiled, didn't it?' The product manager says, 'Can we ship it?'"
  explanation: "This three-person joke format perfectly captures the different priorities of each role. The escalating absurdity of applying their professional mindsets to a simple bar visit creates humor through incongruity while satirizing workplace dynamics."
  rating: 9

- text: "I have a theory that bugs are quantum: they exist in a superposition of 'working' and 'broken' until a tester observes them."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke applies quantum mechanics concepts to software testing, creating humor through the unexpected connection. It also captures the real phenomenon where bugs seem to appear only when someone's watching, using scientific language for comedic effect."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't testers ever win at poker? Because they always assume everyone's bluffing and demand to see the cards before betting."
  explanation: "This joke characterizes the tester's skeptical mindset through an analogy to poker. The incongruity of applying professional verification habits to a game where trust and risk are essential creates humor while highlighting the tester personality."
  rating: 7

- text: "The first rule of testing: there is never enough testing. The second rule of testing: see rule one. The third rule: those weren't bugs, they were 'undocumented features.' The fourth rule: we don't talk about production."
  explanation: "This parodies Fight Club's rules while creating a comprehensive satire of testing culture. Each rule builds on the previous one, escalating from truth to cynicism to dark humor about production failures. The multi-layered reference and progression from realistic to absurd creates sophisticated humor that rewards technical knowledge."
