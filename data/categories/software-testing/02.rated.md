- text: "QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity pattern to illustrate how QA engineers think - they don't just test the happy path, but try to break the system with edge cases, invalid inputs, and random data. The escalating absurdity of the orders mirrors real test case scenarios."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do testers make terrible party guests? They always find something wrong with the setup."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke that applies the professional habit of finding bugs to everyday situations, using the superiority theory where we laugh at the exaggerated stereotype of testers being overly critical."
  rating: 5

- text: "A tester's favorite season? Fall. Because everything crashes."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning - 'fall' as both a season and what software does when it fails. The misdirection from expecting a nature-related answer to getting a technical one creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Unit tests are like a seat belt - nobody thinks they need them until there's a crash."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses analogy to highlight the preventive nature of testing. The humor comes from the recognition of a common attitude where people undervalue safety measures until disaster strikes."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer break up with their test suite? Too many commitment issues."
  explanation: "A relationship metaphor applied to version control and testing. The double meaning of 'commit' (both in relationships and in Git) creates the wordplay, while commenting on the frustration of maintaining tests."
  rating: 7

- text: "Software testing: where 'it works on my machine' goes to die."
  explanation: "This plays on the infamous developer excuse and positions testing as the reality check. The relief theory applies here as testers vent about developers' denial of environment-specific bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many testers does it take to change a light bulb? None. They just document that it's dark."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic light bulb joke format. It highlights the stereotype that testers only report problems without fixing them, using incongruity between expectation (fixing) and reality (documenting)."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my manager we needed more time for testing. He said, 'Test in production like everyone else.'"
  explanation: "A dark humor take on poor development practices. The absurdity of the terrible advice creates humor through relief theory - we laugh because it's unfortunately relatable but we know it's wrong."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: "This metaphor captures the paradox of fixing your own bugs. The incongruity of being both investigator and culprit creates humor while expressing a universal programmer experience."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't testers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including bugs."
  explanation: "A science pun adapted to testing context. The double meaning of 'make up' (constitute vs. fabricate) combined with the tester's skeptical mindset creates layered humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "My test coverage is like my New Year's resolutions - looks great on paper, mostly aspirational."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor using analogy. The comparison between two things we claim to do but often don't follow through on creates relatable humor through shared experience."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation and confidence."
  explanation: "This aphorism exposes the arbitrary nature of how we classify software behavior. The cynical truth behind it creates humor through recognition of workplace politics and spin."
  rating: 8

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Then crawls. Then teleports. Then files 37 tickets about the door."
  explanation: "An extended version of the walking-into-a-bar joke that demonstrates boundary testing and creative test scenarios. The escalating absurdity and the final detail about filing tickets captures QA thoroughness humorously."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the test fail? Because success is just an untested failure waiting to happen."
  explanation: "A philosophical take on Murphy's Law applied to testing. The paradoxical wisdom creates humor through the pessimistic but often true perspective that everything eventually breaks."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Stay buggy, my friends."
  explanation: "A meme format parody that jokes about terrible practices. The relief theory applies as we laugh at the anti-pattern while recognizing the pressure that sometimes leads to it."
  rating: 6

- text: "Tester's prayer: Grant me the serenity to accept the bugs I cannot fix, the courage to report the ones I can, and the wisdom to know the difference before the deadline."
  explanation: "A parody of the Serenity Prayer adapted to testing realities. The humor comes from applying spiritual wisdom to mundane technical frustrations, with the deadline twist adding urgency."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why are integration tests like family reunions? Everything works fine separately, but put them together and chaos erupts."
  explanation: "A brilliant analogy comparing technical integration problems to family dynamics. The universal experience of both situations creates strong relatable humor through the incongruity pattern."
  rating: 9

- text: "Found a bug in production. The developers said it's a feature. I said it's a feature I'm documenting as a critical bug."
  explanation: "This captures the eternal conflict between developers and testers using wordplay. The passive-aggressive response creates humor through the power dynamics and stubborn adherence to proper classification."
  rating: 7

- text: "Test automation is like teaching a robot to be paranoid. Except the robot never sleeps and remembers every time you lied about 'this will never happen.'"
  explanation: "An extended metaphor that personifies automated testing while highlighting its relentless nature. The callback to developer overconfidence creates a satisfying multi-layered joke."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the QA engineer bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the code had high coverage and wanted to check if it was actually reaching the top branches."
  explanation: "A sophisticated pun playing on 'coverage,' 'branches,' and 'reaching' - all testing terminology given physical interpretation. The absurdist visual combined with the technical accuracy creates excellent wordplay humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A developer, a tester, and a product manager walk into a bar. The developer says 'it works,' the product manager says 'ship it,' and the tester says 'hold my beer' and proceeds to order NULL, DROP TABLE orders--, and a beer with a 50-character name containing emoji. The bar crashes. The tester sighs, 'See you in production.'"
  explanation: "The ultimate testing joke that combines multiple humor patterns: setup-punchline structure, SQL injection reference, edge case testing, professional stereotypes, and resigned cynicism about deployment practices. The escalation from simple order to chaos, ending with the inevitable production deployment despite obvious problems, creates a perfect storm of relatable technical humor that works on multiple levels."
