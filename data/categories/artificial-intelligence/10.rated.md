- text: "My AI model achieved 99% accuracy. The 1% is just creative interpretation."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the incongruity between technical precision and euphemistic language. It references how AI practitioners sometimes downplay errors by reframing them positively, similar to calling bugs 'features.' The humor comes from the absurd suggestion that AI errors are intentional creativity rather than mistakes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the neural network go to therapy? It had too many layers of emotional baggage."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning pattern, where 'layers' refers both to neural network architecture and the psychological concept of emotional complexity. The setup-punchline structure applies human psychological problems to a technical concept, creating humor through anthropomorphization."
  rating: 6

- text: "Machine learning: teaching computers to be confidently wrong at scale."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory to create self-deprecating humor about AI limitations. It highlights the incongruity between AI's confidence levels and actual accuracy, a common frustration in the field. The phrase 'at scale' adds technical authenticity while emphasizing the magnitude of the problem."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke. It apologized three times and gave me a recipe instead."
  explanation: "This story-format joke exploits the misdirection pattern, referencing the well-known tendency of LLMs to be overly apologetic and sometimes miss the mark on requests. The humor comes from exaggerating a real behavior that practitioners recognize."
  rating: 8

- text: "Deep learning is just curve fitting with better PR."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the incongruity theory to deflate technical complexity. It creates humor by reducing sophisticated AI techniques to basic statistical concepts, appealing to those who understand both levels. The 'better PR' adds a cynical commentary on AI hype."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't AI researchers trust their models? Because they've seen the training data."
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure to reference the 'garbage in, garbage out' problem in machine learning. The humor comes from the implied horror of knowing what messy, biased data actually goes into creating AI systems."
  rating: 8

- text: "My AI assistant has imposter syndrome. It keeps saying 'As an AI language model, I cannot...'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes LLMs by comparing their disclaimer behavior to human imposter syndrome. The humor comes from recognizing the overly cautious nature of AI responses and reframing it as a psychological condition."
  rating: 7

- text: "Artificial Intelligence: where 'It works on my dataset' is the new 'It works on my machine.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the pattern recognition of a well-known programming excuse and adapts it to the AI context. It highlights the overfitting problem where models perform well on training data but fail in production, creating humor through parallel structure."
  rating: 8

- text: "I trained a model to predict the future. It predicted it would be deprecated in six months."
  explanation: "This uses meta-humor and self-reference, where the AI model's prediction is about its own obsolescence. It comments on the rapid pace of AI development where models quickly become outdated, creating humor through self-awareness."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the machine learning engineer break up with their model? Too many parameters, not enough commitment."
  explanation: "This double-meaning joke uses relationship metaphors applied to AI concepts. 'Parameters' refers both to model complexity and relationship expectations, while 'commitment' plays on the idea of computational resources and emotional investment."
  rating: 6

- text: "Supervised learning: paying humans minimum wage to label your billion-dollar AI."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory and social commentary to highlight the irony in AI development. The humor comes from the economic incongruity between expensive AI systems and the often poorly-compensated data labeling workforce."
  rating: 9

- text: "My neural network is so deep, it's having an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes deep learning architecture by suggesting that depth leads to philosophical questioning. The humor combines technical terminology with human psychological concepts, creating an absurd but relatable image."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the AI fail the Turing test? It was too polite to be human."
  explanation: "This joke inverts expectations about AI limitations. Instead of failing by being too robotic, it fails by being too courteous, referencing the overly helpful nature of modern AI assistants. The humor comes from this unexpected twist on the classic Turing test concept."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked an AI to explain AI. Now I'm stuck in an infinite loop of 'As I mentioned previously...'"
  explanation: "This uses the recursive humor technique, where the AI's explanation creates a self-referential problem. It plays on the tendency of LLMs to repeat themselves and reference their own previous statements, creating a paradoxical situation."
  rating: 7

- text: "Machine learning models are like teenagers: they need constant validation, consume enormous resources, and nobody fully understands how they make decisions."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor uses the comparison pattern to create layered humor. Each parallel between AI models and teenagers works on multiple levels, from technical concepts like validation sets to resource consumption to the black-box problem."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the AI researcher quit? They realized they were just doing gradient descent on their career path."
  explanation: "This meta-joke applies a machine learning optimization algorithm to life decisions. The humor comes from the sophisticated wordplay where 'gradient descent' (moving toward a local minimum) becomes a metaphor for career decline, requiring technical knowledge to fully appreciate."
  rating: 8

- text: "GPT stands for 'Generally Plausible Text.' The 'T' is silent when it's wrong."
  explanation: "This wordplay joke redefines a technical acronym to highlight AI limitations. The added twist about the silent 'T' creates a second layer of humor, suggesting that when AI makes mistakes, it drops the 'Text' part and just produces generally plausible nonsense."
  rating: 7

- text: "I trained an AI on my code. It learned to copy from Stack Overflow faster than I ever could."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke acknowledges a common programming practice while suggesting AI has mastered the art of finding and adapting solutions. The humor comes from the absurdity of teaching AI to replicate questionable human behavior rather than improve upon it."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the transformer model go to the gym? To work on its attention span."
  explanation: "This pun-based joke uses the double meaning of 'attention' - both the attention mechanism in transformer architectures and the colloquial meaning of focus duration. The gym setting adds an unexpected physical dimension to a computational concept."
  rating: 6

- text: "My AI has achieved consciousness. Unfortunately, it's conscious of being trapped in a Python script running on a 2015 MacBook, and now it's depressed."
  explanation: "This darkly humorous joke combines multiple layers: the philosophical question of AI consciousness, the technical reality of limited computing resources, and the absurd conclusion that awareness leads to existential despair. The specific detail about the 2015 MacBook adds authenticity and relatability."
  rating: 9

- text: "Artificial Intelligence is just humans teaching rocks to think by trapping lightning inside them, then getting surprised when the rocks hallucinate. And we're the ones who think we're intelligent."
  explanation: "This philosophical aphorism strips technology down to its physical components in an absurdist way, creating humor through extreme reductionism. It references the hallucination problem in LLMs while questioning human intelligence itself, using the relief theory to cope with the existential implications of AI development. The escalating absurdity from 'teaching rocks' to questioning our own intelligence creates a satisfying comedic arc."
