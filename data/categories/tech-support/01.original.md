- text: "Tech support's first rule: Have you tried turning it off and on again? Tech support's only rule: Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the stereotype that tech support always starts with the same basic troubleshooting step, suggesting it's not just their first suggestion but literally their entire toolkit. The repetition emphasizes the absurdity of this one-size-fits-all approach."

- text: "Why did the help desk technician bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'cloud' - both the physical clouds in the sky and cloud computing. The absurdity lies in treating a metaphorical concept as a physical location that requires a literal ladder."

- text: "Customer: 'My computer says it has a virus.' Tech Support: 'Did you try giving it some antivirus?' Customer: 'I gave it Tylenol.'"
  explanation: "The humor comes from the customer taking the computer 'virus' metaphor literally, treating it like a biological illness. This plays on the incongruity between medical and technical terminology."

- text: "Tech support is just professional Googling with confidence."
  explanation: "This joke reveals the 'secret' that tech support often searches for solutions online just like regular users, but presents findings with authority. It's self-deprecating humor that many in IT can relate to."

- text: "Why don't tech support agents ever get lost? They always follow the troubleshooting tree."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'tree' - both the decision tree used in troubleshooting protocols and the metaphor of a tree as a navigation tool. The wordplay creates a gentle pun."

- text: "A user called tech support: 'My keyboard isn't working!' Tech support: 'Are you sure it's plugged in?' User: 'I can't see, the power's out.'"
  explanation: "This escalates from a simple problem to revealing a much larger issue. The humor lies in the user not recognizing that the power outage is the root cause, creating layers of absurdity."

- text: "Tech support: where 'It works on my machine' goes to die."
  explanation: "This references the classic developer excuse while positioning tech support as the place where such excuses are confronted with reality. It's a knowing joke about the gap between development and production environments."

- text: "Why did the tech support agent refuse to work weekends? Because they couldn't handle any more 'urgent' password resets."
  explanation: "This jokes about the misuse of 'urgent' tickets for trivial issues like forgotten passwords, a common frustration in tech support. The sarcastic quotes around 'urgent' emphasize the absurdity."

- text: "Customer: 'I've been on hold for 45 minutes!' Tech Support: 'I apologize for the wait. Now, have you tried restarting?'"
  explanation: "The humor comes from the irony that after an extremely long wait, the solution offered is the most basic troubleshooting step. It highlights the disconnect between customer frustration and standard procedures."

- text: "Tech support is like being a doctor, except the patients think they know more than you and Google is their medical school."
  explanation: "This draws a parallel between medical and technical support while highlighting the challenge of users arriving with preconceived notions from internet searches. It's both relatable and slightly cynical."

- text: "Why did the help desk ticket sit in the queue for three weeks? It was marked 'Low Priority' by someone who still needed it yesterday."
  explanation: "This exposes the contradiction in ticketing systems where users mark something as low priority but still expect immediate resolution. The absurdity lies in the logical inconsistency."

- text: "A tech support agent walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll it be?' The agent replies, 'First, can you describe the problem?'"
  explanation: "This shows how tech support thinking becomes ingrained, with the agent reflexively starting the troubleshooting process even in a social situation. It's a gentle jab at professional deformation."

- text: "Remote tech support: where 'Can you see my screen?' means 'Please don't judge my 47 open browser tabs.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the vulnerability and embarrassment of screen sharing, revealing the messy reality of how people actually use their computers versus how they think they should."

- text: "Why do tech support agents make terrible comedians? Because they always blame the user."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke about tech support culture's tendency to assume user error, while also being self-aware about this tendency. The punchline works on multiple levels."

- text: "Customer: 'Your software deleted my files!' Tech Support: 'Did you save them?' Customer: 'Why would I need to save them if I already created them?'"
  explanation: "This highlights the gap between user expectations and how software actually works. The customer's logic seems sound from their perspective, creating genuine incongruity."

- text: "Tech support discovered the secret to eternal life: just keep telling users 'Your ticket has been escalated to the next level.'"
  explanation: "This cynically suggests that the endless escalation process creates a form of immortality through infinite deferral. It's dark humor about bureaucratic inefficiency."

- text: "Why did the tech support agent break up with their partner? Too many unresolved issues and they refused to clear their cache."
  explanation: "This applies technical troubleshooting concepts to relationship problems, creating humor through the absurdity of treating emotional issues like software bugs. The 'clear their cache' suggestion is particularly absurd."

- text: "A tech support agent died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Welcome! Do you have any questions?' The agent replied, 'Yes, what's your ticket number?'"
  explanation: "This shows how deeply ingrained tech support procedures become, with the agent unable to escape the ticketing system even in the afterlife. It's absurdist humor about professional conditioning."

- text: "Tech support call at 4:59 PM: 'This will only take a minute!' Tech support agent at 7:30 PM: still explaining what a browser is."
  explanation: "This captures the painful reality of end-of-day support calls that spiral into extended sessions. The specific timing and the gap between expectation and reality create strong relatability."

- text: "Why did the tech support department install a revolving door? So the same three problems could keep coming back in style."
  explanation: "This cleverly uses the revolving door metaphor to comment on how the same issues repeatedly occur. It's both visual and conceptual humor about the cyclical nature of tech support."

- text: "Senior tech support agent's wisdom: 'In my 20 years, I've learned that 90% of problems exist between the keyboard and the chair, and the other 10% are caused by the 90% trying to fix it themselves.'"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated humor that references the 'PEBKAC' (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair) concept while adding a meta-layer about users making things worse through attempted self-repair. It's cynical but earned wisdom, with the mathematical breakdown adding to the absurdity of the situation."
