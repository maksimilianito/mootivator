- text: "A RAM stick, a hard drive, and a CPU walk into a diagnostic center. The technician says, 'I can only save two of you.' The RAM says, 'Save me, I'm volatile!' The hard drive says, 'Save me, I have all the memories!' The CPU says, 'Doesn't matter—without me, they're both useless.' The technician unplugs them all and says, 'That's why I keep backups.'"
  explanation: "Extended narrative joke using the classic 'three people walk into' format, creating tension through the trolley problem ethical dilemma, with each component arguing from its technical function, resolved by the superior wisdom of proper backup procedures—meta-humor about IT best practices."

- text: "The server rack caught fire, and as the sprinklers activated, the lead technician calmly said, 'Well, we've been talking about moving to the cloud anyway.

The insurance adjuster wasn't amused, but the junior admin whispered, 'At least now we have a solid disaster recovery story for the next interview.'"
  explanation: "Peak complexity joke combining dark humor about catastrophic failure with wordplay on 'cloud computing,' multiple levels of irony (literal vs. metaphorical cloud, disaster as career opportunity), and the absurdity of maintaining humor during crisis. References real IT culture of turning failures into learning experiences and job interview stories, while the insurance adjuster serves as the 'straight man' to highlight the inappropriate humor, making it meta-commentary on how IT professionals cope with disasters."
