- text: "CSS: Where you spend 3 hours centering a div."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the notorious difficulty web developers face with what seems like a simple task - centering elements using CSS. The incongruity lies in the contrast between the perceived simplicity of the task and the actual time investment required, reflecting a universal frustration in web development."

- text: "Why did the web developer walk into a bar? Because he didn't see the closing tag."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay between physical bars and HTML tags. The joke relies on the double meaning of 'bar' and the common programming error of forgetting closing tags, creating a misdirection where the setup suggests a typical bar joke but delivers a technical punchline."

- text: "HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the clothes, and JavaScript is the personality disorder."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses an extended metaphor comparing web technologies to human characteristics. The unexpected twist comes with JavaScript being labeled a 'personality disorder' rather than something positive, reflecting the chaotic and unpredictable nature of JavaScript behavior that developers often encounter."

- text: "My website is like my diet - full of cookies and cache."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the double meaning of 'cookies' and 'cache' as both web technologies and dietary items. The self-deprecating humor about diets makes the technical concepts more relatable while highlighting how websites track and store user data."

- text: "Why do web developers prefer dark mode? So their code looks better than their life choices."
  explanation: "This combines the popular preference for dark mode IDEs with self-deprecating humor about life decisions. The superiority theory manifests through programmers acknowledging their questionable choices while finding comfort in aesthetic code presentation."

- text: "A web developer's browser history is 90% Stack Overflow and 10% 'how to exit Vim'."
  explanation: "This joke references two universal truths in programming culture: the heavy reliance on Stack Overflow for problem-solving and the notoriously confusing Vim text editor. The exaggerated percentages create humor through recognizable patterns in developer behavior."

- text: "I told my boss I needed a framework. He gave me a picture frame."
  explanation: "This uses the misdirection pattern by playing on the double meaning of 'framework' - as a web development tool versus a literal picture frame. The incongruity between technical expectations and literal interpretation creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Web development: Where 'mobile-first' means you check your phone first to avoid working."
  explanation: "This subverts the technical term 'mobile-first design' by reinterpreting it as procrastination behavior. The joke works through the relief theory, acknowledging the common tendency to avoid work while using industry buzzwords."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#."
  explanation: "This is a multilayered pun combining vision problems with programming language names (JavaScript and C#). The wordplay on 'see sharp' as both a vision issue and the programming language creates a double meaning that requires technical knowledge to fully appreciate."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code works perfectly in production. Said no web developer ever."
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'said no one ever' format to highlight the universal truth that code rarely works flawlessly in production environments. The incongruity lies in the contrast between the idealistic statement and the harsh reality developers face."
  rating: 7

- text: "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it."
  explanation: "This pun plays on 'console' as both emotional consolation and the JavaScript console.log() debugging tool. The anthropomorphization of bugs combined with the technical wordplay creates a simple but effective joke structure."
  rating: 8

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks: 'May I join you?'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure where 'join' has dual meaning - social joining and SQL JOIN operations. The personification of database queries creates an absurd scenario that requires understanding of SQL concepts."
  rating: 8

- text: "Web developers don't die. They just lose their domain."
  explanation: "This aphorism plays on the euphemism 'pass away' by substituting 'lose their domain,' referencing both website domains and the concept of one's domain or realm. The morbid humor is softened by the technical wordplay."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the web developer go broke? Too many cache flow problems."
  explanation: "This pun substitutes 'cash flow' with 'cache flow,' connecting financial problems with technical caching issues. The joke works on multiple levels for those who understand both business terminology and web performance concepts."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying my CSS is bad, but my divs have trust issues and refuse to align."
  explanation: "This uses anthropomorphization to describe CSS layout problems, giving HTML elements human emotions like 'trust issues.' The self-deprecating humor combined with the absurd personification creates a relatable scenario for developers struggling with layouts."
  rating: 8

- text: "A web developer's life cycle: Coffee, code, commit, conflict, cry, repeat."
  explanation: "This creates a recursive pattern using alliteration and the common Git workflow. The progression from productive actions to emotional breakdown reflects the reality of version control conflicts, using the relief theory to acknowledge shared frustrations."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't web developers like nature? Too many bugs and no Stack Overflow."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts the natural world with the digital one, playing on 'bugs' as both insects and code errors. The addition of missing Stack Overflow emphasizes developers' dependency on online resources, creating humor through exaggerated helplessness."
  rating: 8

- text: "My website loads so slowly, users are getting 404 errors on their patience."
  explanation: "This joke creatively applies the HTTP 404 'not found' error to an abstract concept (patience), creating an absurd technical metaphor. The incongruity of applying error codes to human emotions while addressing the real issue of slow loading times makes this effective."

- text: "JavaScript: The only language where you can write 'false' == true and somehow it makes sense to the interpreter but not to you."
  explanation: "This highlights JavaScript's notorious type coercion quirks where seemingly contradictory statements can evaluate to true. The joke captures the existential frustration of JavaScript's loose typing system and the cognitive dissonance it creates."
  rating: 9

- text: "Web development is just Stack Overflow driven development with extra steps and imposter syndrome."
  explanation: "This meta-joke deconstructs modern web development practices, acknowledging the heavy reliance on Stack Overflow while adding the psychological element of imposter syndrome. The reference to 'extra steps' suggests unnecessary complexity while the brutal honesty creates humor through shared experience."
  rating: 9

- text: "A web developer's most used Git command isn't commit or push - it's 'git blame' followed by 'oh wait, that was me.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure with a self-deprecating twist. It references the Git command 'git blame' used to find who wrote problematic code, only to discover self-accountability. The progression from blaming others to self-realization creates humor through recognition of a universal developer experience, combining technical knowledge with human nature."
