- text: "My framework knowledge expires faster than my milk."
  explanation: "This joke uses a simple comparison to highlight how rapidly technology trends change. The incongruity comes from comparing perishable food items with abstract technical knowledge, creating humor through the unexpected parallel and the sad truth that technical skills become outdated incredibly quickly."

- text: "Why did the developer learn React? By the time he finished the tutorial, everyone had moved to the next framework."
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure to emphasize the frustrating pace of JavaScript framework evolution. The humor comes from the exaggerated but relatable experience of technology becoming obsolete before you can even learn it, playing on the relief theory by venting a common developer frustration."

- text: "I finally mastered Angular. My therapist says denial is a healthy coping mechanism."
  explanation: "This joke employs dark self-deprecating humor, suggesting that mastering an aging framework is so futile that believing it's still relevant requires psychological defense mechanisms. The incongruity between technical skill and mental health creates unexpected humor."

- text: "What's the difference between a technology trend and a mayfly? The mayfly lives for 24 hours."
  explanation: "This joke uses comparative humor and exaggeration to mock how short-lived technology trends are. The punchline subverts expectations by suggesting that even an insect with one of the shortest lifespans lives longer than most tech trends, creating humor through absurd comparison."

- text: "I put 'blockchain expert' on my resume in 2017. Now I'm a 'legacy systems maintainer.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the rapid obsolescence of technology trends through temporal irony. What was cutting-edge just a few years ago is now considered outdated, and the speaker hasn't even changed jobs—just the perception of their skills has shifted dramatically."

- text: "Quantum computing will change everything! Just like blockchain, AI, IoT, cloud, mobile-first, and the Segway."
  explanation: "This joke uses a list structure to create pattern recognition, then breaks it with 'Segway' to emphasize how technology hype cycles often fail to deliver on revolutionary promises. The humor comes from grouping legitimate technologies with a famously failed product."

- text: "Why don't developers trust technology predictions? Because they're still waiting for the Year of Linux Desktop."
  explanation: "This joke references a long-running meme in tech culture about Linux desktop adoption being perpetually 'next year.' It uses shared cultural knowledge to create humor about overhyped predictions that never materialize, employing both superiority and relief theories."

- text: "My startup pivoted so many times, we're now facing the direction we started."
  explanation: "This joke uses geometric absurdity to mock how startups chase trends. The visual image of pivoting 360 degrees creates humor through the realization that constant trend-chasing can lead you back to where you began, making all the effort pointless."

- text: "What's a developer's favorite exercise? Jumping to new frameworks."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay between physical exercise and the professional behavior of constantly switching technologies. The double meaning creates humor through the incongruity of treating framework-hopping as a fitness activity, with the implication that it's exhausting."

- text: "I learned COBOL for job security. Turns out, so did everyone else after seeing those COBOL job postings."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the irony of 'legacy' technologies suddenly becoming valuable again. The humor comes from the reversal of expectations—learning old technology for security, only to find it's become trendy, defeating the original purpose."

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer. Serverless is just someone else's problem."
  explanation: "This joke builds on a famous tech aphorism and extends it with parallel structure. The humor comes from the cynical but accurate observation that trendy buzzwords often just shift responsibility rather than eliminate problems, using misdirection to deliver insight."

- text: "Why did the AI engineer get lost? He kept following the hype cycle instead of the map."
  explanation: "This joke uses a simple metaphor comparing navigation to career decisions. The humor emerges from treating abstract professional trends as literal directions, highlighting how following hype leads nowhere productive, using the incongruity theory effectively."

- text: "My code is microservices-ready. It already breaks into small, independent pieces on its own."
  explanation: "This joke uses self-deprecating humor about code quality while mocking the microservices trend. The incongruity between intentional architectural decisions and accidental code fragmentation creates humor through the unexpected reframing of bugs as features."

- text: "What's the half-life of a JavaScript framework? The time it takes to npm install it."
  explanation: "This joke combines scientific terminology with a specific technical reference to create humor about framework obsolescence. The exaggeration suggests frameworks become outdated in the time it takes to download them, playing on the notoriously slow npm install process."

- text: "I'm not saying technology moves fast, but my 'cutting-edge' laptop is now a doorstop with RGB lighting."
  explanation: "This joke uses litotes (understatement) and absurd imagery to comment on hardware obsolescence. The specific detail of RGB lighting adds humor by suggesting even the decorative features outlast the functional utility, creating a vivid comic image."

- text: "Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in five years? Developer: Still explaining why we shouldn't rewrite everything in whatever is trendy then."
  explanation: "This joke subverts a common interview question with a cynical but accurate prediction. The humor comes from the meta-awareness that the specific technology will change but the pattern of chasing trends won't, using the setup-punchline structure effectively."

- text: "Web 3.0 will revolutionize the internet! Just like Web 2.0 revolutionized Web 1.0, which revolutionized... wait, what did Web 1.0 revolutionize?"
  explanation: "This joke uses recursive questioning to mock how each technology generation claims to be revolutionary. The humor builds through the pattern, then deflates by questioning the premise itself, exposing the circular nature of hype cycles through logical deconstruction."

- text: "My company adopted DevOps, Agile, microservices, and containers. We still ship bugs, just with more YAML now."
  explanation: "This joke lists multiple trendy methodologies and technologies, then delivers a punchline that nothing fundamental has changed except added complexity. The specific mention of YAML adds technical authenticity while highlighting how trends often add overhead without solving core problems."

- text: "What's the difference between a technology evangelist and a prophet? The prophet doesn't get stock options when their predictions fail."
  explanation: "This joke uses comparative structure to satirize how technology advocates benefit from hype regardless of outcomes. The humor comes from the cynical observation about misaligned incentives, using the superiority theory to critique the tech industry's hype machine."

- text: "I asked ChatGPT what the next big technology trend would be. It said 'ChatGPT.' I asked Bard the same question. It also said 'ChatGPT.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses recursive meta-humor about AI hype by having AI systems predict themselves as the next trend. The additional layer of a competing AI agreeing adds to the absurdity, creating humor through self-referential awareness and the incongruity of AI lacking self-interest."

- text: "The tech industry's approach to innovation: Take something that works, add AI, blockchain, and 'as a service,' then charge subscription fees. Congratulations, you've just disrupted toast."
  explanation: "This joke uses a formula structure to mock how the industry applies buzzwords to everything, then delivers an absurd punchline with 'toast'—the most mundane possible example. The humor comes from reducing grandiose innovation rhetoric to its ridiculous essence, exposing how meaningless trend-chasing can be through extreme juxtaposition."
