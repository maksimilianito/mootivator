- text: "Documentation: where code goes to be misunderstood in writing."
  explanation: "This plays on the irony that documentation, meant to clarify code, often ends up confusing readers instead. It's a simple statement that inverts the expected purpose of documentation."

- text: "Why don't developers write documentation? Because the code is self-explanatory... to them."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common developer bias where they assume their code is obvious, not realizing that 'self-documenting code' only works if you're the one who wrote it."

- text: "Our API documentation is like a mystery novel—full of suspense and missing chapters."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor to describe incomplete documentation, comparing it to a thriller with gaps, which creates both frustration and 'suspense' about what the code actually does."

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation once. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "A simple dream-sequence joke that suggests thorough documentation is so rare it's literally a fantasy, playing on the relief theory of humor about common frustrations."

- text: "Documentation status: 'TODO: Write documentation.'"
  explanation: "This meta-joke shows documentation that documents its own absence, creating humor through self-reference and the all-too-familiar TODO comment that never gets done."

- text: "Why did the developer's documentation win an award? It was fiction's finest work of the year."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection—you expect praise for good documentation, but the punchline reveals it's so inaccurate or imaginative it qualifies as fiction rather than technical writing."

- text: "My documentation is like fine wine: it doesn't exist yet, but I promise it'll be worth the wait."
  explanation: "This employs the incongruity between the elegant metaphor of aging wine and the reality of perpetually delayed documentation, creating humor through false equivalence."

- text: "What's the difference between documentation and archaeology? Archaeologists expect to find ancient artifacts."
  explanation: "This joke compares reading old documentation to archaeology, but with a twist—even archaeologists have higher success rates at finding useful information than developers reading outdated docs."

- text: "I don't always write documentation, but when I do, I make sure it's for code I deleted yesterday."
  explanation: "Playing on the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format, this highlights the frustrating timing mismatch where documentation effort is wasted on obsolete code."

- text: "Why did the API documentation go to therapy? It had too many unresolved references."
  explanation: "This uses technical terminology ('references') with a double meaning—both programming references and psychological issues needing resolution, creating wordplay humor."

- text: "Our documentation follows the 'mushroom methodology': keep developers in the dark and feed them... well, you know."
  explanation: "This references the mushroom management joke, suggesting documentation is so poor it actively obscures information rather than illuminating it, creating dark humor about organizational dysfunction."

- text: "What do you call documentation that's actually up-to-date? A hallucination."
  explanation: "This plays on AI terminology ('hallucination') while suggesting that current documentation is so rare it must be an illusion or error in perception."

- text: "I asked for the documentation. They sent me a README that said 'Good luck.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke builds expectation of receiving help, then delivers the ultimate unhelpful 'documentation'—a sarcastic well-wish that acknowledges the code is impenetrable."

- text: "Why do developers prefer writing code to writing docs? Because compilers don't complain about missing comments."
  explanation: "This highlights the incentive problem in software development—code must work to pass compilation, but documentation has no enforcement mechanism, leading to its neglect."

- text: "My documentation has three versions: the one I wrote, the one that exists, and the one developers actually need."
  explanation: "This plays with the concept of multiple realities, highlighting how documentation degrades over time and rarely matches actual requirements, creating humor through the absurd multiplication of versions."

- text: "What's a developer's favorite type of documentation? The kind written by someone else, about someone else's code, that they'll never have to maintain."
  explanation: "This longer-form joke builds through accumulation, adding conditions that make documentation progressively more appealing by removing all personal responsibility and consequence."

- text: "I tried to write documentation so good that even I could understand it six months later. I failed, but I set a personal record for optimism."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke acknowledges the universal experience of not understanding your own old code, while adding a meta-layer about the futility of the attempt itself."

- text: "Why did the documentation get promoted? It successfully described what the code was supposed to do, which was more than the code itself managed."
  explanation: "This reversal joke flips the normal relationship between code and documentation—here the documentation is more accurate about intended functionality than the buggy implementation, creating absurdist humor."

- text: "Our documentation strategy is revolutionary: we let the users write it through Stack Overflow questions."
  explanation: "This cynical joke describes the reality of many projects where community forums become the de facto documentation, reframing neglect as an innovative 'strategy' through absurdist corporate-speak."

- text: "What's the longest distance in software engineering? The gap between 'See documentation for details' and actual documentation existing."
  explanation: "This uses the setup of a measurement question to deliver a punchline about the infinite void between documentation promises and reality, playing with the concept of distance metaphorically."

- text: "I finally understood why they call it 'living documentation'—it's because it's in a constant state of decay, just like everything alive. The only difference is that documentation skips straight to decomposition without the living part."
  explanation: "This dark humor joke takes the positive concept of 'living documentation' and extends the metaphor to its logical but morbid conclusion, creating humor through unexpected biological realism applied to technical concepts. The extended explanation adds a second punchline about documentation never being truly 'alive' in the first place."
