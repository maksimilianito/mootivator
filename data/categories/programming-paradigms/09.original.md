- text: "Functional programmers don't have side effects. They have 'unintended features.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the core principle of functional programming (avoiding side effects) while using the classic programmer excuse of calling bugs 'features.' It's a simple wordplay that highlights the paradigm's emphasis on purity."

- text: "Why did the object-oriented programmer get stuck in the shower? The shampoo bottle said 'Lather, Rinse, Repeat' but didn't specify the exit condition."
  explanation: "This uses the classic infinite loop joke structure, applying OOP's literal interpretation of instructions. The humor comes from treating everyday instructions as code without proper termination logic."

- text: "Procedural programming: telling the computer how to do everything. Declarative programming: telling the computer what you want and hoping it figures it out."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts two paradigms through the lens of control and trust, highlighting the philosophical difference between imperative and declarative approaches with a touch of skepticism."

- text: "An object-oriented programmer walked into a bar. He inherited the drinks."
  explanation: "A simple pun on OOP's inheritance mechanism, applying the technical concept to a social situation. The double meaning of 'inherited' creates the humor through unexpected application."

- text: "Why do functional programmers prefer maps over loops? Because they can't handle the state of things."
  explanation: "This plays on functional programming's avoidance of mutable state while using 'state' as a double meaning for both technical state and emotional condition, suggesting functional programmers are emotionally sensitive."

- text: "Object-oriented programming: where your coffee cup is an object that inherits from the beverage class and implements the drinkable interface."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates OOP's tendency to over-architect simple concepts, mocking the paradigm's formalism by applying it to mundane objects. It highlights the sometimes excessive abstraction in OOP."

- text: "How many object-oriented programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just create a new LightBulb instance and deprecate the old one."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic lightbulb joke format by showing how OOP thinking approaches problems through object creation rather than direct manipulation, highlighting the paradigm's abstraction mindset."

- text: "Functional programming is like mathematics. Object-oriented programming is like real life. And procedural programming is like giving directions to someone who takes everything literally."
  explanation: "This three-way comparison uses analogy to characterize each paradigm's philosophy, with the procedural punchline adding humor through the image of an overly literal instruction-follower."

- text: "A functional programmer's spouse asks: 'Can you go to the store and buy milk?' The programmer returns with one milk. 'Why just one?' 'You didn't map over an array.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic programmer-spouse miscommunication format but adds functional programming's specific concept of mapping over collections, showing how FP thinking can lead to overly literal interpretations."

- text: "Why did the procedural programmer refuse to use objects? He had too many issues to encapsulate."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'issues' refers both to personal problems and software bugs, while 'encapsulate' works as both an OOP concept and hiding problems. It suggests resistance to paradigm shift."

- text: "In object-oriented programming, everything is an object. In functional programming, everything is a function. In my programming, everything is a mistake."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke follows a rule-of-three pattern, setting up two paradigm definitions before subverting expectations with honest personal failure, creating humor through contrast and relatability."

- text: "What's the difference between a functional programmer and an object-oriented programmer at a party? The functional programmer composes themselves. The OOP programmer inherits their parents' social skills."
  explanation: "This uses technical terms (compose and inherit) as double meanings for both programming concepts and personal behavior, creating parallel humor that works on both technical and social levels."

- text: "Why don't functional programmers ever get into arguments? Because they avoid side effects at all costs."
  explanation: "This applies FP's core principle of avoiding side effects to social interaction, where arguments would be 'side effects' of conversation. The humor comes from taking technical purity to an absurd social extreme."

- text: "An object-oriented programmer died. His funeral had multiple inheritance, but nobody could figure out which parent to notify first."
  explanation: "This dark humor joke uses OOP's controversial multiple inheritance feature to create a morbid scenario where the technical problem (diamond problem) manifests as social confusion at a funeral."

- text: "Functional programming: where you spend three hours writing a beautiful, elegant solution to avoid one mutable variable. And you're proud of it."
  explanation: "This joke gently mocks FP's ideological purity by highlighting the sometimes disproportionate effort to maintain immutability, while acknowledging that practitioners genuinely value this approach despite the time investment."

- text: "Why did the object break up with the class? Too much coupling, not enough cohesion."
  explanation: "This relationship joke uses OOP design principles (coupling and cohesion) as relationship advice, where technical code smells become relationship problems, creating humor through the unexpected application of software metrics to romance."

- text: "A procedural programmer, an OOP programmer, and a functional programmer walk into a bar. The procedural programmer orders drinks step by step. The OOP programmer creates a DrinkOrder object with a Bar.serve() method. The functional programmer composes the bar, the drinks, and the drinking into a pure function that returns a hangover monad."
  explanation: "This extended joke contrasts all three paradigms' approaches to the same problem, with escalating complexity that mocks each style's characteristic approach, culminating in FP's tendency toward abstract mathematical concepts."

- text: "Object-oriented programming promised us reusability. Instead, we got inheritance hierarchies so deep that by the time you reach your class, you've inherited 47 methods you don't need and can't override the one you do."
  explanation: "This joke critiques OOP's broken promise of reusability through inheritance, highlighting the real-world problem of deep inheritance hierarchies that create more problems than they solve, with specific exaggeration for comedic effect."

- text: "Why do functional programmers make terrible storytellers? They refuse to maintain state, so every story starts with 'Once upon a time' and never gets past the initial values."
  explanation: "This joke takes FP's statelessness to an absurd extreme, imagining storytelling without state progression. The humor lies in the impossibility of narrative without change, highlighting how fundamental mutability is to certain contexts."

- text: "I tried to explain monads to my therapist. Now she's the one who needs therapy."
  explanation: "This meta-joke plays on the notorious difficulty of explaining monads (a functional programming concept), suggesting the explanation is so confusing it causes psychological distress. It's self-aware humor about FP's steep learning curve."

- text: "Object-oriented programming is like a restaurant where every dish is a subclass of Food, implements Edible, and has a private method for digestion that you can't access but somehow still gives you indigestion. And the waiter insists this is 'proper encapsulation.'"
  explanation: "This extended metaphor brilliantly captures OOP's absurdities: over-abstraction, access modifiers that don't actually protect you, and the insistence that complex architecture is 'proper' design. The real-world consequences (indigestion) despite 'proper' encapsulation delivers the final comedic punch about OOP's sometimes hollow promises."
