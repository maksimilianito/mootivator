- text: "RAM stands for 'Remember? Already forgot.'"
  explanation: This joke plays on the acronym RAM (Random Access Memory) and its volatile nature - data stored in RAM is lost when power is removed. The wordplay suggests RAM's temporary memory matches our own forgetfulness, creating a simple double meaning between technical terminology and human experience.

- text: "Why did the developer name their cat 'Syntax'? Because it always had errors."
  explanation: This uses the misdirection pattern by setting up an expectation about naming a pet, then delivers a punchline connecting the cat's name to programming terminology. The humor comes from applying the frustrating concept of syntax errors to a misbehaving pet.

- text: "I told my friend I work in 'the cloud.' Now he thinks I'm a meteorologist."
  explanation: This joke exploits the confusion between technical jargon and everyday language. 'The cloud' is abstract tech terminology that sounds literal to non-technical people, creating incongruity between what the speaker means and what the friend understands.

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of party? A LAN party - because they finally understand the networking!"
  explanation: This plays on the double meaning of 'networking' - both computer network connections (LAN) and social networking at parties. The humor suggests programmers prefer technical networking to social networking, a self-deprecating stereotype.

- text: "My boss asked me to explain 'bandwidth.' I said I'd get back to him when I have the capacity."
  explanation: This uses wordplay between 'bandwidth' (data transfer capacity) and 'capacity' (personal availability). The speaker cleverly demonstrates the concept while explaining why they can't explain it, creating meta-humor through the response itself.

- text: "Why don't computers ever get hungry? They have plenty of bytes and chips."
  explanation: A straightforward pun using computer terminology (bytes, chips) that also refers to food. This simple wordplay works on the incongruity between technical components and snack foods, accessible to all audiences.

- text: "I asked IT to help me understand 'cookies.' They sent me to HR for eating the office snacks."
  explanation: This joke uses misdirection by exploiting the confusion between browser cookies (data files) and actual cookies. The escalation to HR adds an absurd element that amplifies the misunderstanding between technical and non-technical interpretations.

- text: "What's the difference between a virus and a feature? About six months of denial."
  explanation: This cynical joke plays on the tech industry phrase 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' and suggests that problematic software behavior gets rebranded rather than fixed. The time element adds realism to the corporate decision-making satire.
  rating: 9

- text: "My computer has 'terminal' illness. The doctor said it's just a command prompt."
  explanation: This uses double meaning between 'terminal' (a serious medical condition) and 'terminal' (command-line interface). The punchline reassures that the 'illness' is actually just a normal technical feature, playing with medical and technical vocabulary.

- text: "Why did the acronym go to therapy? It had too many issues to resolve."
  explanation: This meta-joke plays on how tech acronyms often have multiple meanings and how 'resolve' works in both psychological and technical contexts (resolving issues/bugs). It comments on the confusing nature of technical jargon itself.
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally understand 'legacy code' - it's what we inherit from people who are no longer around to explain it."
  explanation: This joke uses the double meaning of 'legacy' (inheritance/old systems) and 'inherit' (receive from deceased/take over code). It captures the real frustration of working with undocumented old code while making a dark but relatable observation.
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call a group of confused programmers? A syntax error meeting."
  explanation: This plays on collective nouns and the idea that when programmers gather to discuss problems, the confusion itself becomes like a syntax error - something that prevents proper functioning and needs debugging.
  rating: 6

- text: "My manager asked for 'transparency' in our code. So I set all the variables to 'null' - now you can see right through them!"
  explanation: This joke uses the incongruity between corporate buzzwords (transparency as honesty) and technical concepts (transparency as visibility, null as empty). The literal interpretation of transparency creates an absurd but technically logical solution.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why is 'deprecated' the saddest word in programming? Because it means your code is old enough to be rejected but not old enough to be vintage."
  explanation: This joke captures the emotional reality of technology obsolescence. It plays on how 'deprecated' sounds serious and final, while highlighting the narrow window between 'current' and 'classic' in the fast-paced tech world.
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to explain 'recursion' to my friend, but to understand it, they first needed to understand recursion."
  explanation: This is a self-referential joke that demonstrates recursion through its own structure. The humor comes from the circular logic that mirrors the technical concept being explained, creating frustration and enlightenment simultaneously.
  rating: 10

- text: "What's the difference between 'beta' and 'release candidate'? Marketing decided the first one sounded too honest."
  explanation: This cynical joke exposes how technical terminology gets sanitized for public consumption. It suggests that software quality doesn't change, only the label, highlighting the gap between technical reality and marketing spin.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to use 'plain English'? Because it wasn't compiled yet."
  explanation: This joke plays on the superiority of technical language in programming culture. The absurd suggestion that plain English needs to be 'compiled' (converted to machine code) inverts the normal relationship between human and computer languages.
  rating: 7

- text: "My code has great 'abstraction' - even I can't understand what it does anymore."
  explanation: This self-deprecating joke plays on 'abstraction' (hiding complexity) taken to an absurd extreme. It captures the real problem where over-engineering creates code so abstract that it becomes incomprehensible, even to its creator.
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call documentation that actually matches the code? Fiction."
  explanation: This brutally honest joke uses the setup-punchline structure to deliver a harsh truth about software development. The single-word punchline 'Fiction' suggests that accurate documentation is so rare it might as well be imaginary.
  rating: 9

- text: "Why is 'backward compatibility' an oxymoron? Because moving forward means breaking everything from yesterday."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke comments on the tension between progress and stability in software development. It suggests that 'backward compatibility' contradicts itself because real advancement inevitably breaks old systems, making the phrase philosophically impossible.
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally decoded what 'enterprise-grade' means: expensive enough that nobody questions whether it works."
  explanation: This cutting joke deconstructs corporate jargon by suggesting that 'enterprise-grade' is more about price signaling than quality. The cynical observation that high cost creates credibility rather than reflecting value captures a real dynamic in corporate tech purchasing.
