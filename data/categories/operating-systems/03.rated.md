- text: "Windows users see an error message. Linux users see an opportunity to recompile."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the different philosophies and user experiences between Windows (proprietary, user-friendly) and Linux (open-source, customizable). Windows users are passive recipients of errors, while Linux users are empowered to fix things themselves through source code access."
  rating: 7

- text: "macOS: It just works. Until it doesn't. Then it just costs."
  explanation: "This aphorism parodies Apple's famous slogan 'It just works' while highlighting the reality that when Apple products fail, repairs are notoriously expensive due to proprietary hardware and limited repair options."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Linux user get lost in the forest? Because he refused to follow the path and insisted on creating his own."
  explanation: "This joke uses the metaphor of a forest path to represent the Linux philosophy of customization and control. Linux users are stereotypically known for wanting to configure everything themselves rather than accepting defaults."
  rating: 6

- text: "An operating system is like underwear: you don't think about it until something goes wrong."
  explanation: "This analogy uses the incongruity of comparing technical infrastructure to intimate apparel. Both are essential, work invisibly in the background, and only demand attention when they fail."
  rating: 8

- text: "Windows Update: Because 3 AM is the perfect time to restart your computer."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the notorious Windows Update behavior of restarting computers at inconvenient times, often when users have left work running overnight. The sarcasm emphasizes the frustration of forced updates."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't Linux users ever get invited to parties? They spend the whole time explaining why the party should be open source."
  explanation: "This plays on the stereotype of Linux evangelists who passionately advocate for open-source software in all contexts, even social situations where it's inappropriate or unwanted."
  rating: 8

- text: "Chrome OS: For when you want an operating system that's just a browser pretending to be more."
  explanation: "This joke points out that Chrome OS is essentially Google Chrome browser with minimal additional functionality, highlighting its limited capabilities compared to traditional operating systems."
  rating: 6

- text: "I'd tell you a joke about FreeBSD, but you probably haven't heard of it."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke that plays on FreeBSD's relative obscurity compared to Linux and Windows, while also parodying the 'hipster' trope of liking obscure things."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between Windows and a virus? Viruses don't slow down over time."
  explanation: "This uses superiority humor to mock Windows' reputation for becoming progressively slower with use, contrasting it with viruses that maintain consistent performance. The comparison itself is absurdly unflattering."
  rating: 5

- text: "Ubuntu: Linux for people who want to tell others they use Linux without actually learning Linux."
  explanation: "This joke pokes fun at Ubuntu's reputation as the 'easy' Linux distribution, suggesting that Ubuntu users get the social credit of being Linux users without the technical depth required by other distributions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A Windows user, a Mac user, and a Linux user walk into a bar. The Windows user orders a beer. The Mac user orders an expensive craft IPA. The Linux user brings his own homebrew and explains the recipe to everyone."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic 'walk into a bar' format to characterize the three user types: Windows users are mainstream and straightforward, Mac users are premium and trendy, and Linux users are DIY enthusiasts who over-share technical details."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the system administrator install Linux on his coffee maker? Because it was the only appliance that didn't already run it."
  explanation: "This plays on the reality that Linux actually does run on countless embedded devices and appliances. The reversal of expectations (finding something that doesn't run Linux) creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "macOS: Where the command line is just a tourist attraction for developers who miss real Unix."
  explanation: "This joke acknowledges that while macOS is Unix-based, it's primarily a GUI-focused system where the terminal is secondary, unlike traditional Unix systems where the command line is central."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to explain to my grandma the difference between Windows and Linux. Now she thinks I'm in a cult."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection and plays on the passionate, almost religious fervor with which some Linux users advocate for their OS, making it seem cult-like to outsiders."
  rating: 8

- text: "Windows: We've replaced your familiar interface with something completely different. Again. You're welcome."
  explanation: "This satirizes Windows' history of dramatic UI changes (Windows 8, Windows 11, etc.) that frustrate users who had finally learned the previous version, presented as if these changes are favors."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers love Unix? Because it's the only place where 'rm -rf /' is considered a learning experience."
  explanation: "This dark humor references the infamous command that deletes everything on a Unix system. The joke is that Unix philosophy treats even catastrophic mistakes as educational opportunities rather than preventing them."
  rating: 8

- text: "Android is just Linux wearing a Google costume and pretending it doesn't know its parents."
  explanation: "This personification joke highlights that Android is built on the Linux kernel but has diverged so far from traditional Linux that it barely acknowledges its heritage, while Google maintains tight control."
  rating: 7

- text: "A Linux user finally switches to Windows after 20 years. His first thought: 'Where do I type sudo?'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on muscle memory and the fundamental difference in how Linux and Windows handle administrative tasks. The Linux user is so conditioned to using 'sudo' that it's their instinctive response."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why was the operating system therapist so busy? Because Windows had identity issues, Linux had commitment problems, and macOS just wanted everyone to like it."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the three major operating systems with psychological problems that mirror their real characteristics: Windows' frequent reinventions, Linux's fragmentation, and Apple's focus on user experience and approval."
  rating: 9

- text: "I installed Arch Linux. How do I know? Don't worry, I'll tell you. Every five minutes. For the rest of your life."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke about Arch Linux users' notorious tendency to constantly mention they use Arch, playing on the 'How do you know someone does X? They'll tell you' joke format. It's self-aware humor about Linux culture itself."
  rating: 10

- text: "An operating system is just a program that's really good at pretending to be a computer while simultaneously pretending the hardware doesn't exist. Except when it crashes. Then it's very honest about both."
  explanation: "This philosophical joke captures the paradox of operating systems: they abstract away hardware complexity while managing it, creating an illusion of simplicity. When they fail, this illusion collapses and users are confronted with the underlying complexity they'd been shielded from. It's a deep observation about the nature of OS design wrapped in humor."
