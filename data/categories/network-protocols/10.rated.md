- text: "TCP tried to tell a joke, but kept repeating the setup until everyone confirmed they heard it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on TCP's reliable delivery mechanism where packets are acknowledged and retransmitted if not received, creating an image of an overly cautious storyteller."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did UDP break up with TCP? Too much commitment."
  explanation: "This contrasts TCP's connection-oriented, reliable protocol with UDP's connectionless, fire-and-forget approach, using relationship terminology to highlight the difference."
  rating: 8

- text: "HTTP walks into a bar and asks for a beer. The bartender says 'GET out of here!'"
  explanation: "This uses the HTTP GET method as a pun, where the technical term coincides with the colloquial phrase for ejecting someone."
  rating: 6

- text: "An IPv4 address walked into a bar. An IPv6 address walked into a bar. The bar had enough room for both, finally."
  explanation: "This references the address space exhaustion problem of IPv4 and how IPv6's massive address space solves it, personifying the protocols as patrons."
  rating: 7

- text: "DNS is like that friend who always knows where everyone lives but takes forever to remember."
  explanation: "This compares DNS lookup delays and caching behavior to a forgetful but knowledgeable friend, highlighting the latency involved in name resolution."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't network engineers trust stairs? They prefer layers."
  explanation: "A play on the OSI model's layered architecture, substituting physical stairs with protocol layers in a pun format."
  rating: 5

- text: "ICMP walked into a bar. 'You can't stay,' said the bartender. 'I'm just here to report an error,' ICMP replied."
  explanation: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for error reporting and diagnostics, not data transmission, which this joke personifies as a messenger who doesn't stick around."
  rating: 7

- text: "A packet walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we don't serve your type here.' The packet fragments and tries again."
  explanation: "This references packet fragmentation when packets are too large for a network segment, showing persistence through technical adaptation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the HTTP request so polite? It always used proper headers."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where HTTP headers are technical requirements, but 'proper headers' also suggests good manners and etiquette."
  rating: 5

- text: "FTP and SFTP walk into a bar. The bartender asks for ID. Only SFTP gets served."
  explanation: "This highlights the security difference between FTP (unencrypted) and SFTP (secure), where authentication and security are represented by ID checking."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the REST API go to therapy? It had too many stateless relationships."
  explanation: "REST's stateless nature, where each request is independent, is compared to emotionally distant relationships, creating humor through the mismatch of technical and emotional contexts."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SYN packet walks into a bar. The bartender sends back SYN-ACK. The packet never responds. The bartender waits forever."
  explanation: "This describes a SYN flood attack or incomplete TCP handshake, where the three-way handshake never completes, leaving the server hanging."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't routers ever get lost? They always know the best path, even if it's through 47 other routers."
  explanation: "This jokes about routing protocols finding paths while simultaneously mocking how internet traffic often takes convoluted routes to reach destinations."
  rating: 6

- text: "SMTP tried to deliver a joke but it got caught in the spam filter. The punchline was too commercial."
  explanation: "This plays on email delivery issues and spam filtering, suggesting that even jokes can be filtered if they seem too promotional."
  rating: 7

- text: "Two network packets met at a router. 'Race you to the destination!' said one. They arrived in opposite order."
  explanation: "This illustrates packet reordering in networks where packets can take different paths and arrive out of sequence, creating a race with an ironic outcome."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the network administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the higher layers of the OSI model."
  explanation: "A literal interpretation of the OSI model's 'layers' combined with the fact that higher layers (like application layer) are more abstract and distant from hardware."
  rating: 5

- text: "A broadcast packet walks into a bar and announces its presence to everyone. Half the room ignores it, but it keeps talking anyway."
  explanation: "Broadcast packets are sent to all devices on a network regardless of whether they need the information, much like someone who won't stop talking to a disinterested audience."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did TCP and UDP get into a fight? TCP wanted to talk about it, but UDP didn't care if the message got through."
  explanation: "This contrasts TCP's reliable, connection-oriented nature with UDP's unreliable, connectionless approach, framing it as a relationship conflict about communication styles."
  rating: 8

- text: "An SSL certificate walks into a bar. The bartender asks for ID. The certificate says, 'I AM the ID, and I'm verified by someone you trust, who was verified by someone THEY trust, who...' The bartender pours a drink."
  explanation: "This brilliantly captures the chain of trust in SSL/TLS certificates, where certificates are verified through a hierarchy of certificate authorities, creating a recursive proof of identity."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the network engineer break up with their partner? They said, 'It's not you, it's the latency in our connection.' The partner replied, 'I got that message 3 seconds ago.'"
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke uses network latency as a breakup metaphor, then demonstrates the actual latency problem in the delayed response, making the technical issue part of the joke's structure itself."
  rating: 10

- text: "A NAT router walks into a bar with 254 friends. The bartender says, 'One IP address, one drink.' The router replies, 'Don't worry, we'll share, but you'll never know which one of us is actually drinking at any given moment.'"
  explanation: "This perfectly encapsulates Network Address Translation, where multiple private IP addresses hide behind a single public IP, making it impossible for the outside world to distinguish individual devicesâ€”a complex concept delivered through an absurdist bar scenario."
