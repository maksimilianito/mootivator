- text: "My linked list broke up with me. Said I had too many pointers to my ex."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'pointers' - both as references in linked lists and as references to past relationships. It anthropomorphizes a data structure to create a relatable breakup scenario."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the array go to therapy? It had zero-based issues."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'zero-based indexing' (a programming concept) and 'deep-seated issues' (a therapy term), suggesting the array has psychological problems stemming from starting at index 0."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my binary tree a secret. Now the whole forest knows."
  explanation: "This joke plays on how binary trees have parent-child relationships and branches, suggesting information spreads through the tree structure like gossip spreads through social networks."
  rating: 5

- text: "Stacks are the most polite data structure. They always remember LIFO - Last In, First Out. Like holding doors."
  explanation: "This creates an unexpected connection between the LIFO principle of stacks and polite social behavior, where the last person to enter holds the door for others."
  rating: 6

- text: "My hash table has commitment issues. It keeps saying 'It's complicated' when I ask about collisions."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes hash tables and plays on the relationship status 'It's complicated' while referencing the technical challenge of hash collisions."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't trees ever win arguments? Because they always have to consider both sides."
  explanation: "This plays on binary trees having left and right children, suggesting this balanced structure makes them indecisive in arguments."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked my queue how it was doing. It said 'I'm fine, just waiting my turn.'"
  explanation: "This personifies a queue and references its FIFO (First In, First Out) nature, where elements patiently wait to be processed in order."
  rating: 6

- text: "Arrays and linked lists went to couples therapy. The therapist said 'You both have valid points, but your access times are incompatible.'"
  explanation: "This creates a relationship metaphor around the fundamental trade-off between arrays (fast random access) and linked lists (fast insertion/deletion), framing it as relationship incompatibility."
  rating: 8

- text: "My graph is so social, it has connections everywhere. Unfortunately, they're all weighted with drama."
  explanation: "This plays on weighted graphs (where edges have values) and social networks, suggesting the 'weights' represent emotional baggage or drama in relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to organize a party for data structures. The heap showed up early and said 'I'm the maximum!' Everyone else was just... unordered."
  explanation: "This references max heaps (where the root is the maximum value) and the partially ordered nature of heap structures, creating a scenario where the heap is both technically correct and socially obnoxious."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the circular linked list break up with its partner? The relationship was going nowhere."
  explanation: "This plays on the circular nature of circular linked lists, which loop back to the beginning, creating a metaphor for a relationship that's stuck in a cycle."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer's spouse asked: 'Why do you love trees so much?' He replied: 'Because they're the only thing in my life that's perfectly balanced.' She said: 'Have you checked for rotations lately?'"
  explanation: "This references self-balancing trees (like AVL or Red-Black trees) that require rotations to maintain balance, suggesting even 'perfect' balance requires constant work - a metaphor for relationships."
  rating: 8

- text: "My deque is having an identity crisis. It can't decide if it's coming or going."
  explanation: "This plays on double-ended queues (deques) that allow insertion and deletion from both ends, creating a humorous identity crisis about directionality."
  rating: 6

- text: "I implemented a stack of regrets. Now I can't stop popping off about my mistakes."
  explanation: "This uses the stack operation 'pop' and the colloquial phrase 'popping off' (talking excessively), creating a layered joke about dwelling on past mistakes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the binary search tree go to the gym? To work on its balance factor. The AVL tree was its personal trainer."
  explanation: "This references AVL trees (self-balancing binary search trees) that maintain a strict balance factor, personifying them as a fitness trainer helping regular BSTs 'get in shape.'"

- text: "A linked list walks into a bar. The bartender says 'Sorry, we don't serve your type here.' The linked list replies: 'That's fine, I'll just follow my next pointer to another bar.' Three hours later, it's still traversing and hasn't found the bar. It was a circular reference."
  explanation: "This creates a narrative joke that starts with a classic 'walks into a bar' setup, then subverts it by having the linked list follow pointers, ultimately revealing it's stuck in a circular linked list - a programming bug that causes infinite loops."

- text: "My trie told me I was being too prefix-ious. I said 'That's not even a word!' It replied: 'Not yet, but give me a few more nodes and we'll see.'"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated wordplay on 'prefixes' (how tries store strings) and 'pretentious,' while also referencing how tries build words incrementally through their structure. The meta-humor about word construction mirrors how tries actually work."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my red-black tree why it was always so moody. It said 'I have to keep changing colors to stay balanced. Do you know how exhausting that is?' I suggested therapy. It said 'Already tried it - kept rotating between different perspectives.'"
  explanation: "This creates an extended metaphor comparing red-black tree rebalancing operations (color changes and rotations) to emotional labor and therapy, with multiple layers of technical and psychological humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "A hash table, a binary tree, and an array are arguing about who's the fastest. The hash table says 'O(1), baby!' The array says 'O(1) for me too!' The binary tree sighs and says 'O(log n), but at least I'm sorted.' The hash table and array look at each other nervously. 'Yeah,' says the array, 'but I need contiguous memory.' The hash table whispers: 'And I'm useless if you need order.' The binary tree smiles: 'Guess we all have our trade-offs.' They all nod and order O(n) beers."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated narrative joke that demonstrates deep understanding of Big O notation, data structure trade-offs (time vs. space complexity, ordering vs. speed), and concludes with a unifying punchline about the O(n) operation they can all agree on - iterating through all elements."
  rating: 10

- text: "My skip list is the overachiever of data structures. Regular linked list: one pointer. Skip list: 'What if I had multiple pointers at different levels? What if I could skip ahead?' It's basically a linked list that read too many self-help books about taking shortcuts to success. And you know what? It actually works. O(log n) search time. Sometimes anxiety IS a feature."
  explanation: "This creates a personality profile for skip lists, comparing their probabilistic multiple-level structure to an anxious overachiever, while acknowledging that this 'anxiety' (extra complexity) actually provides better performance - a sophisticated commentary on how optimization often requires additional complexity."

- text: "A junior dev asks a senior dev: 'Why do you always use a trie for autocomplete?' Senior dev: 'Because it's literally a tree of possibilities that gets more specific as you go deeper. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, except every path is a valid word, and you can predict the future.' Junior dev: 'That's... actually beautiful.' Senior dev: 'Also it's O(m) where m is the length of the word, which means-' Junior dev: 'You ruined it.' Senior dev: 'That's why we call it a try-e. We try to make it poetic, but we're engineers.'"
  explanation: "This is a meta-narrative joke that explores the beauty of trie data structures while simultaneously acknowledging the tension between poetic description and technical precision. The final punchline plays on the pronunciation 'try' while commenting on engineers' inability to stay purely poetic, creating multiple layers of self-aware humor about technical communication."
