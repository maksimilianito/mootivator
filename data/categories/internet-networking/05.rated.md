- text: "My WiFi signal is like my motivation—strongest when I'm closest to the source, gone when I need it most."
  explanation: "This joke uses a simple comparison between WiFi signal strength and personal motivation, creating humor through the relatable incongruity of both being unreliable at crucial moments. The technical concept of signal degradation over distance is applied to an emotional state."

- text: "Why don't routers ever win arguments? They keep dropping their points."
  explanation: "A play on the double meaning of 'dropping points'—both losing an argument and the technical issue of packet loss in networking. The personification of routers creates an unexpected comparison between debate and data transmission."

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break. It said 'Connection timeout.'"
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes the computer, creating humor through the incongruity of applying a networking error message to a human need for rest. The 'timeout' error becomes a literal response to taking a break."

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer that you're paying to worry about instead."
  explanation: "This aphorism deconstructs the mystique of 'cloud computing' by revealing its mundane reality, creating humor through the deflation of marketing hype and the shift of anxiety rather than its elimination."

- text: "My internet speed is so slow, I clicked on a link and it opened on my neighbor's computer first."
  explanation: "An absurdist exaggeration that creates humor through impossible physics—the data somehow traveling to the wrong destination due to slowness. This hyperbole emphasizes the frustration of poor connectivity."

- text: "Why did the packet go to therapy? It had too many layers of emotional baggage."
  explanation: "A sophisticated pun on the OSI model's network layers and the common metaphor of 'emotional baggage.' The technical concept of packet encapsulation becomes a psychological issue requiring therapy."

- text: "404: Sense of humor not found. Please check your URL and try again."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that uses the famous HTTP error code to comment on itself, creating recursive humor. The instruction to 'check your URL' adds a layer of misdirection about where the humor actually resides."

- text: "I'm not saying my ISP is slow, but I still haven't finished downloading the internet from 1995."
  explanation: "This joke combines temporal absurdity with technical impossibility—'downloading the internet'—while creating humor through extreme exaggeration of slow service. The specific year adds nostalgic context."

- text: "Ping: the only time it's socially acceptable to repeatedly poke someone until they respond."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor by comparing the network diagnostic tool 'ping' with annoying social behavior, highlighting the incongruity between acceptable technical practice and unacceptable human interaction."

- text: "My password is like my social life: complex, frequently changing, and I can never remember it when I need it."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating comparison that uses security best practices (complex, rotating passwords) as a metaphor for an chaotic personal life, creating humor through the unexpected parallel."

- text: "Why did the website break up with its hosting service? It needed more space."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke playing on both storage space in hosting and the common breakup line about needing personal space. The anthropomorphization of technical services creates the humorous scenario."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Just kidding—I'm not a network administrator."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the expectation by setting up a confession of bad practice, then deflecting blame to another IT role, creating humor through misdirection and inter-departmental stereotyping."
  rating: 8

- text: "The best thing about a boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit."
  explanation: "A sophisticated technical pun that works on multiple levels: 'bit' as both a small amount and the fundamental unit of computing, while referencing boolean's binary nature. The wordplay creates layered humor."

- text: "My router has more connections than I do, and it still drops them constantly."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke compares social connections with network connections, creating humor through the irony that even with more connections, the router is still unreliable—implying the speaker's social situation might actually be more stable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't networks ever gossip? Because what happens in the subnet, stays in the subnet."
  explanation: "A clever parody of the famous Las Vegas slogan applied to network segmentation. The technical concept of subnet isolation becomes a humorous code of silence, personifying network infrastructure."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked the internet for its opinion. Three hours later, I had 47 contradictory answers, two conspiracy theories, and a recipe for lasagna."
  explanation: "This joke captures the chaotic, unfocused nature of online information through absurdist specificity. The unexpected lasagna recipe provides the punchline through complete irrelevance to any possible question."

- text: "TCP and UDP walk into a bar. The bartender says 'I'll serve you.' TCP says 'Can you confirm you'll serve me?' UDP doesn't wait for an answer and orders anyway."
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke contrasting reliable TCP protocol (which requires acknowledgment) with unreliable UDP protocol (which doesn't). The bar scenario makes abstract networking concepts concrete and humorous through personification."
  rating: 10

- text: "My code works perfectly on my machine. Unfortunately, my machine lives in a parallel universe where physics and logic are merely suggestions."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the classic 'works on my machine' problem through absurdist escalation, suggesting the developer's environment is so unique it operates under different fundamental laws of reality."
  rating: 9

- text: "There are two types of people: those who backup their data, and those who will."
  explanation: "A dark humor aphorism that plays with temporal logic and inevitable disaster. The joke's power comes from the ominous certainty that everyone eventually learns this lesson the hard way."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally understood recursion when I finally understood recursion when I finally understood recursion when I..."
  explanation: "A perfect example of meta-humor that demonstrates the concept it's explaining. The joke becomes recursive itself, creating an infinite loop that programmers will immediately recognize and appreciate."

- text: "The Internet: where you came for answers, stayed for cat videos, and somehow ended up reading a 3 AM Wikipedia article about the history of doorknobs."
  explanation: "This joke captures the universal experience of internet distraction through specific, relatable escalation. The journey from purposeful search to completely random topic creates humor through recognition of our collective inability to stay focused online."
