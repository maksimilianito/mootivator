- text: "My CS professor said 'garbage collection' would be automatic. Turns out I still have to take out the trash."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'garbage collection' - in programming it's an automatic memory management feature, but the student misunderstood it as literal garbage. The humor comes from the incongruity between the technical concept and everyday life, plus the mild disappointment of the student."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to class? To reach higher-level languages."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'higher-level' which in programming refers to languages that are more abstract and easier to use (like Python vs Assembly), but is interpreted literally as physical height. The absurdity of bringing a ladder creates the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "My university offers a degree in theoretical computer science. The graduation ceremony is still in beta."
  explanation: "This jokes about the abstract nature of theoretical CS by suggesting even the graduation is theoretical/not fully implemented. 'Beta' is software development terminology for incomplete versions, applied humorously to an academic ceremony."
  rating: 7

- text: "CS 101: Where you learn that 'Hello World' is the hardest program you'll ever write... because you have to set up the entire development environment first."
  explanation: "This reflects the real frustration of beginners who expect programming to be about writing code, but spend hours installing software, configuring paths, and troubleshooting environment issues. The incongruity is that the simplest program becomes the hardest due to setup complexity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't CS students ever finish their homework on time? They're still waiting for their code to compile."
  explanation: "This exaggerates a common student experience where compilation times (especially in languages like C++) can be lengthy. The humor comes from the absurd implication that compilation takes so long it prevents homework completion."
  rating: 6

- text: "My algorithms professor walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 999999999 beers. Orders -1 beers. Orders a lizard. The bar passes all test cases."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated joke about edge case testing and boundary conditions taught in algorithms classes. Good testing requires checking normal cases, extreme values, negative numbers, and completely invalid inputs - exactly what the professor orders."
  rating: 9

- text: "In my CS program, we learned that P vs NP is unsolved. My student loans are also NP: Non-Payable."
  explanation: "This plays on the famous unsolved problem in computer science (P vs NP) by creating a fake but plausible meaning for NP related to student debt. The humor comes from connecting academic theory to the very real financial struggles of students."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS student fail the Turing Test? He kept trying to prove he was human by showing his debugging skills. No human is that patient."
  explanation: "This inverts the usual Turing Test concept (can machines seem human?) by suggesting that programmers' inhuman patience with debugging makes them seem like machines. It's a self-deprecating joke about programmer behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "My data structures professor said trees grow upside down in computer science. Finally, an explanation for why my academic career is also inverted."
  explanation: "In CS, tree data structures are drawn with the root at the top and leaves at the bottom (upside down from nature). The student humorously applies this to their struggling academic performance, suggesting they're also 'upside down' or backwards."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do CS students make terrible historians? They think legacy code means anything written last semester."
  explanation: "This jokes about the rapid pace of technology change in CS education, where even recent code feels ancient. 'Legacy code' typically means old, outdated systems, but CS students experience such fast changes that last semester feels like ancient history."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my CS advisor about work-life balance. She said, 'Oh, you mean load balancing? That's a distributed systems course.'"
  explanation: "This uses misdirection where the advisor misinterprets the human concern of work-life balance as the technical concept of load balancing (distributing computing work across servers). The humor highlights how CS education can make people think in purely technical terms."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include a philosophy course? So students could ponder: 'If a function is called in the forest and no one is there to catch the exception, does it still throw an error?'"
  explanation: "This parodies the famous philosophical question 'If a tree falls in a forest...' by converting it to programming terms. It humorously suggests philosophy helps with deep programming questions, while also highlighting the abstract nature of exception handling."
  rating: 9

- text: "My operating systems professor told us about race conditions. Now three students are racing to finish the assignment first, and we're all getting different results."
  explanation: "This creates a meta-joke where students literally racing mirrors the technical concept of race conditions (when timing of operations affects outcomes). The 'different results' works both for the race condition problem and the students' varied assignment solutions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't CS professors ever retire? Because they're stuck in an infinite loop of 'just one more semester.'"
  explanation: "This applies the programming concept of an infinite loop (code that never terminates) to the academic tendency to keep teaching. The phrase 'just one more semester' parallels the 'just one more iteration' thinking that creates infinite loops."
  rating: 7

- text: "My university's CS department motto: 'We put the "science" in Computer Science by making you repeat experiments until you get different results each time.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes both the unpredictability of programming (where code mysteriously works differently on reruns) and the scientific method (which expects repeatable results). The humor is in celebrating the opposite of good science as their motto."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a sleeping bag to the lab? His professor said they'd be covering threads, and he wanted to be prepared for a long night."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning: 'threads' in programming (concurrent execution paths) and 'threads' as in bedding. The joke also references the notorious all-nighters CS students pull, suggesting the student misunderstood but was accidentally correct about needing to sleep there."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my CS professor I was having an identity crisis. He said, 'Have you tried checking your UID?'"
  explanation: "This plays on 'identity crisis' (psychological concept) vs UID (User Identifier in Unix systems). The professor's technical response to an emotional problem humorously shows how CS education makes people think in system terms even for human issues."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why is a CS degree like a binary search? You keep eliminating half your social life until you find the one thing you're looking for: graduation."
  explanation: "This cleverly applies the binary search algorithm (which eliminates half the search space each iteration) to the student experience of sacrificing social activities. The structure mirrors the algorithm while commenting on CS student lifestyle."
  rating: 9

- text: "My compiler design course taught me that syntax errors are easy to fix. Semantic errors are harder. But the hardest error is realizing you're in the wrong major—and that's a runtime error that occurs at graduation."
  explanation: "This creates a hierarchy of programming errors (syntax, semantic, runtime) and applies it to life choices. The delayed discovery (at runtime/graduation) of being in the wrong major is a sophisticated joke about both programming concepts and the real anxiety of career choice."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum committee meet for six months to change one course requirement? They were using waterfall methodology."
  explanation: "This satirizes academic bureaucracy by comparing it to the waterfall development model (known for being slow and inflexible). The joke works on multiple levels: mocking both outdated software development practices and academic decision-making processes."
  rating: 8

- text: "A CS student's final exam question: 'Explain why your code works.' The student wrote: 'I don't know, I'm just as surprised as you are.' The professor gave full marks, commenting: 'First honest answer I've seen all semester. Welcome to software engineering.'"
  explanation: "This is the culmination joke that captures the essence of CS education: the humbling realization that sometimes code works mysteriously. The professor's response validates this as genuine learning—understanding that uncertainty is part of the field. It's funny because it's deeply true and subverts expectations of academic rigor."
