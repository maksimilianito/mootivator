- text: "Our sprint planning meetings are so efficient, we schedule them recursively."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that recursive scheduling would create an infinite loop of planning meetings, making them the opposite of efficient. It highlights the common problem of meetings about meetings in software development."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to use waterfall methodology? Because they preferred to fail fast, not slow."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts the sequential nature of waterfall (where failures are discovered late) with agile's 'fail fast' philosophy, using misdirection to highlight a common criticism of waterfall development."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our definition of done keeps evolving. Currently, it's defined as 'when the PM stops asking questions.'"
  explanation: "This uses incongruity between the formal concept of 'definition of done' in agile and the practical reality of when work actually stops, poking fun at scope creep and endless stakeholder feedback."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's code review comments? About 500 words of diplomatic phrasing."
  explanation: "This joke highlights how senior developers have learned to soften their criticism through experience, using the superiority theory to comment on professional maturity in a self-aware way."
  rating: 9

- text: "We practice continuous integration. Our build breaks continuously, and we integrate apologies into our daily standups."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'continuous' in CI/CD, creating humor through the gap between the ideal (continuous integration) and the reality (continuous failures)."
  rating: 8

- text: "My team uses Scrum. We're very agile at moving deadlines."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the meaning of 'agile' from its intended purpose (adapting to change) to the unintended consequence (constantly shifting timelines), using irony to comment on common project management failures."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do developers love pair programming? Because two people can watch the code compile together."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection to suggest that the benefit of pair programming isn't collaboration but rather shared waiting time, poking fun at slow compilation times."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our retrospectives are very productive. We've identified the same three problems for six months now."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the gap between identifying problems and actually solving them, using repetition and futility to comment on ineffective agile practices."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a developer's favorite part of Scrum? The sprint, because it sounds fast even when it isn't."
  explanation: "This plays on the incongruity between the athletic metaphor of 'sprint' and the often slow reality of software development, using wordplay to highlight unrealistic expectations."
  rating: 5

- text: "We follow test-driven development religiously. We pray our tests pass before writing them."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'religiously' (strictly following vs. literally praying) to comment on the anxiety around TDD, combining incongruity with relatable developer stress."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the project manager bring a ladder to standup? To reach the ever-rising scope."
  explanation: "This visual joke uses the physical metaphor of climbing to represent scope creep, making the abstract problem of expanding requirements concrete and absurd."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our code review process is thorough. First, we review the code. Then, we review our life choices."
  explanation: "This uses escalation humor, starting with a normal statement and ending with existential crisis, reflecting the emotional journey of reviewing particularly bad code."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call a developer who finishes a project on time and under budget? A liar."
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure with a dark twist, playing on the universal experience of projects going over time and budget, using exaggeration for effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "We've adopted microservices architecture. Now instead of one large problem, we have 47 small problems that can't talk to each other."
  explanation: "This joke perfectly captures the trade-offs of architectural decisions, using specific numbers to make the distributed systems complexity more concrete and absurd."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why don't developers trust the staging environment? Because it's where code goes to behave perfectly before breaking in production."
  explanation: "This uses the classic setup of the staging-production discrepancy, creating humor through the personification of code that 'behaves' differently in different environments."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our team practices extreme programming. Extremely late nights, extreme coffee consumption, and extremely optimistic estimates."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the formal XP methodology by redefining 'extreme' to match the exhausting reality of development work, using parallel structure for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a software roadmap and a fantasy novel? The fantasy novel has better world-building and more believable timelines."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses superiority theory to suggest that even fiction is more realistic than software planning, with a two-part punchline that reinforces the absurdity."
  rating: 9

- text: "We do daily standups. They last an hour because everyone's too tired to stand, so we sit and discuss why we're behind schedule."
  explanation: "This joke layers multiple incongruities: standups where people sit, 'daily' meetings that are too long, and meta-discussion about the problems the meeting is supposed to solve."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Scrum Master become a therapist? Because after years of asking 'What's blocking you?' they realized they were already doing therapy."
  explanation: "This joke draws a parallel between Scrum ceremonies and therapy sessions, using career change as a vehicle to comment on the emotional labor of managing development teams."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our CI/CD pipeline is so advanced, it automatically deploys bugs to production before we even finish writing them. We call it 'predictive deployment.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdist humor and technical terminology to create a fictional feature that satirizes overly aggressive automation, with the deadpan term 'predictive deployment' adding to the absurdity."
  rating: 10

- text: "What's the most unrealistic part of science fiction? Not the faster-than-light travel or the aliens. It's the software projects that get completed according to the original specifications without a single scope change or last-minute feature request from stakeholders who appear five minutes before the deadline to completely redesign the UI."
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating specificity and a run-on structure to build up to an absurdly accurate description of real software development, using the contrast between sci-fi impossibilities and the even more impossible scenario of smooth project execution."
