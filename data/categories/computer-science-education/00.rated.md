- text: "My CS professor said recursion would eventually click. I'm still waiting for the base case."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the concept of recursion in computer science, where a function calls itself until it reaches a base case. The student is metaphorically stuck in an infinite loop of not understanding, waiting for their comprehension to reach its 'base case' (the stopping condition)."
  rating: 8

- text: "Computer Science degree: Four years to learn what Stack Overflow could teach you in four minutes."
  explanation: "This is a self-deprecating observation about CS education versus practical learning. It creates humor through exaggeration and the incongruity between formal education's time investment and the instant gratification of online resources."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to class? Because the course was about high-level programming languages."
  explanation: "A simple pun that plays on the double meaning of 'high-level' - both a physical height and a programming term describing languages that abstract away machine details."
  rating: 4

- text: "My CS curriculum had three phases: 'This is easy,' 'I hate my life,' and 'I am a god.'"
  explanation: "This captures the emotional roller coaster of CS education through three distinct stages, using the superiority theory where students oscillate between confidence and despair before achieving mastery."
  rating: 9

- text: "The CS department's motto: 'We teach you to think like a computer, so you can spend your career explaining things to humans.'"
  explanation: "This highlights the ironic disconnect between CS education's focus on computational thinking and the reality that communication skills are equally important in the profession."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my CS advisor about work-life balance. He said, 'That's a boolean - it doesn't exist in this major.'"
  explanation: "A technical joke using the concept of booleans (true/false values) to suggest that work-life balance is undefined or null in CS programs, playing on the stereotype of overworked CS students."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our Operating Systems final was so hard, three students went into kernel panic."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'kernel panic' (a critical OS error) as a metaphor for students' mental state during a difficult exam, creating humor through the application of technical concepts to human experiences."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do CS professors love teaching sorting algorithms? Because it's the only thing in their lives that's properly organized."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke plays on the stereotype of disorganized academics while creating irony between the precision of algorithms and the chaos of personal life."
  rating: 6

- text: "My Data Structures class taught me that life is like a linked list - you never know what's coming next, and traversing it is O(n)."
  explanation: "This applies technical concepts (linked lists and Big O notation) to life philosophy, creating humor through the incongruity of using computational complexity to describe existential uncertainty."
  rating: 7

- text: "The CS department installed a suggestion box. It's been stuck in an infinite loop of complaints about infinite loops."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that uses the concept of infinite loops recursively - the complaints themselves form the pattern they're complaining about, creating a self-referential paradox."
  rating: 9

- text: "I graduated with honors in Computer Science. My parents still ask when I'm going to fix their printer."
  explanation: "This highlights the disconnect between academic CS education (theoretical and algorithmic) and what non-technical people think CS graduates do (IT support), using the superiority theory through shared frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our AI course taught us machine learning. Ironically, we learned the machines are better at learning than we are."
  explanation: "This creates humor through role reversal and irony - students learning about systems that outperform them at the very task they're trying to master, touching on both humility and technological advancement."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include philosophy? So students could ponder 'P vs NP' while questioning their existence."
  explanation: "This joke connects one of computer science's most famous unsolved problems (P vs NP) with existential philosophy, suggesting CS education leads to both technical and existential crises."
  rating: 8

- text: "My Algorithms professor said, 'Life is NP-complete.' I said, 'So you're telling me I should just use a heuristic?' He gave me extra credit."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses computational complexity theory - if life's problems are NP-complete (no efficient exact solution exists), using heuristics (approximate solutions) is pragmatic, showing the student applied their learning cleverly."
  rating: 9

- text: "The CS curriculum is perfectly designed: by the time you learn a technology, it's deprecated."
  explanation: "This addresses the frustration of rapid technological change making academic knowledge obsolete, using irony to highlight the gap between educational timelines and industry evolution."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our Database course final had a question: 'Normalize your life.' I dropped the class."
  explanation: "This plays on database normalization (organizing data efficiently) applied to personal life. The punchline uses 'dropped' with double meaning - both dropping a course and dropping a database table."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do CS students make terrible poets? Because they've been trained that every problem has exactly one optimal solution, but poetry requires embracing ambiguity, multiple interpretations, and worst of all - no unit tests."
  explanation: "This longer-form joke contrasts the deterministic, testable nature of CS education with the ambiguous, subjective nature of art, highlighting how CS training creates a specific cognitive framework that conflicts with creative ambiguity."
  rating: 9

- text: "My Theory of Computation class proved that some problems are undecidable. My GPA proved I was one of them."
  explanation: "This clever self-deprecating joke applies Turing's undecidability theorem (some problems have no algorithmic solution) to the student's own academic performance, suggesting they're a problem that can't be solved."
  rating: 10

- text: "The CS department's teaching method: 'Here's 'Hello World.' Now build Facebook. Due Monday.'"
  explanation: "This exaggerates the steep learning curve in CS education, jumping from the simplest possible program to an impossibly complex system, capturing the feeling of being thrown into the deep end that many CS students experience."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my Compiler Design professor that his lectures were hard to parse. He said, 'That's because you're still in the lexical analysis phase.' I said, 'No, I think there's a semantic error.' He laughed, then failed me."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke uses compiler terminology throughout - parsing, lexical analysis, and semantic errors - to describe communication problems between student and professor, with the dark humor twist that understanding the joke wasn't enough to pass."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why is a CS degree like a binary search tree? You spend years trying to stay balanced, occasionally you need to rotate everything to avoid collapse, and just when you think you've achieved perfect balance, someone tells you that you should have been a B-tree all along because they scale better."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses multiple data structure concepts (BST, balancing, rotation, B-trees) as an extended metaphor for the CS educational experience, culminating in the realization that your approach might have been suboptimal - a common feeling among graduates who discover alternative paths or technologies."
