- text: "Functional programmers don't use loops. They just keep calling themselves until they feel better."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the concept of recursion in functional programming, where functions call themselves instead of using iterative loops. The phrase 'until they feel better' adds a humorous psychological dimension to a technical concept."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the object-oriented programmer get stuck in the shower? The shampoo bottle said 'Lather, Rinse, Repeat' but didn't specify the exit condition."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic infinite loop setup, contrasting how an OOP programmer might literally interpret instructions without proper termination conditions, highlighting the difference between human intuition and programmatic thinking."
  rating: 9

- text: "Procedural programming: Do this, then do that. Object-oriented programming: Ask things to do stuff. Functional programming: Imagine things are already done."
  explanation: "This joke captures the philosophical differences between programming paradigms through increasingly abstract descriptions, with functional programming's declarative nature being the most conceptually distant from everyday thinking."
  rating: 8

- text: "An object-oriented programmer walked into a bar. He couldn't get a drink because he forgot to implement the 'order()' method."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes the OOP concept where objects must have methods defined to perform actions, applying this rigid technical requirement to a social situation."
  rating: 6

- text: "Functional programming is like being vegan: it's probably better for you, you won't shut up about it, and everything takes three times longer."
  explanation: "This joke uses cultural stereotype humor to comment on functional programming's vocal advocates, learning curve, and verbose syntax, while acknowledging its theoretical benefits through comparison to veganism."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to explain object inheritance to my son. Now he expects to automatically get all my properties when I die."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the double meaning of 'inheritance' and 'properties' - both legal/familial terms and OOP concepts - creating humor through the child's literal interpretation of technical terminology."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do functional programmers prefer maps over for-loops? Because they refuse to change state... or their minds."
  explanation: "This joke plays on functional programming's core principle of immutability (not changing state) while also commenting on the stubbornness of paradigm advocates, creating a double meaning."
  rating: 7

- text: "Object-oriented code: 'I have a factory that creates factories that create builders.' Functional code: 'I composed five functions.' Procedural code: 'It works, don't touch it.'"
  explanation: "This joke satirizes the different complexities and attitudes of each paradigm: OOP's tendency toward over-engineering, functional programming's elegance, and procedural programming's pragmatic conservatism."
  rating: 9

- text: "A functional programmer's marriage counselor said, 'You need to be more mutable.' He filed for divorce because his values were immutable."
  explanation: "This joke personifies functional programming's immutability principle, applying it to human relationships where flexibility is actually desirable, creating humor through inappropriate application of technical concepts."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many object-oriented programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just create a new LightBulb instance and let the old one get garbage collected."
  explanation: "This joke highlights OOP's approach to problem-solving through object creation and automatic memory management, contrasting with the direct action approach of actually changing a bulb."
  rating: 8

- text: "Functional programming: where you spend three hours making your code elegant so it can do in one line what took two lines before."
  explanation: "This joke gently mocks functional programming's pursuit of elegance and conciseness, pointing out the ironic time investment required to achieve minimal code, highlighting the difference between theoretical beauty and practical efficiency."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code is so object-oriented that even my bugs are encapsulated. Nobody can see them, not even me."
  explanation: "This joke plays on OOP's encapsulation principle (hiding implementation details) to create humor about how this protective feature can backfire, making bugs harder to find and debug."
  rating: 8

- text: "Declarative programming: 'I want a sandwich.' Imperative programming: 'Go to kitchen. Open fridge. Take bread. Take cheese. Close fridge. Find knife. Cut cheese. Put cheese on bread.'"
  explanation: "This joke illustrates the fundamental difference between declarative (what you want) and imperative (how to do it) paradigms through a relatable everyday scenario, showing how imperative programming requires explicit step-by-step instructions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the functional programmer refuse to go to the party? Because functions with side effects are considered harmful, and parties are nothing but side effects."
  explanation: "This joke references Dijkstra's famous paper 'Go To Statement Considered Harmful' while playing on functional programming's avoidance of side effects, humorously applying this principle to social situations where side effects (interactions) are the entire point."
  rating: 10

- text: "Object-oriented programming promised me reusability. Now I have 47 AbstractFactoryPatternImplementationBase classes and I'm reusing my antidepressants."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes how OOP's promise of code reuse can lead to over-engineering and unnecessarily complex class hierarchies, with the dark humor of the punchline emphasizing the mental toll of dealing with such complexity."
  rating: 10

- text: "A procedural programmer, an OOP programmer, and a functional programmer walk into a bar. The procedural programmer orders drinks step by step. The OOP programmer asks the bartender object to serve drink objects. The functional programmer maps the bar to drinks, filters out the hangovers, and reduces himself to pure happiness. He's still thirsty."
  explanation: "This joke cleverly demonstrates all three paradigms through a single scenario: procedural's sequential approach, OOP's object interactions, and functional programming's higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce), with the punchline highlighting that elegant abstraction doesn't always solve practical problems."
  rating: 10

- text: "I love functional programming because it's so pure. My code has no side effects. My career, however, has severe side effects like unemployment and social isolation."
  explanation: "This joke creates ironic contrast between functional programming's 'purity' and 'lack of side effects' with the very real negative side effects of being too dogmatic about paradigm choice, using self-deprecating humor about career consequences."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do object-oriented programmers love coffee shops? Because they appreciate a good Java interface and understand the importance of proper class structure."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke works on several levels: Java the language, java the coffee slang, interface as both social and technical concept, and class as both social setting and OOP concept, creating humor through overlapping meanings."
  rating: 6

- text: "Functional programming is great until you need to explain to your manager why it took you two weeks to implement a feature that 'just adds numbers together' because you were busy achieving mathematical purity and avoiding monadic side effects in the IO context."
  explanation: "This joke captures the real-world tension between functional programming's theoretical elegance and business pragmatism, using technical jargon (monads, IO context) to emphasize how what sounds simple becomes complex, highlighting the communication gap between developers and management."
  rating: 8

- text: "My object-oriented code is so well-designed that it has more interfaces than a spaceship cockpit, more abstractions than modern art, and more inheritance levels than British royalty. It still doesn't work, but at least it fails with proper encapsulation."
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating metaphors to satirize OOP over-engineering, comparing technical concepts to increasingly absurd real-world equivalents, with the punchline acknowledging that good design doesn't guarantee functionality while maintaining the humor about prioritizing structure over results."
  rating: 9

- text: "Procedural programming is like giving directions: 'Turn left, go straight, turn right.' Object-oriented programming is like GPS: 'Calculating route...' Functional programming is like teleportation: 'You're already there, you just don't know it yet because the computation hasn't been evaluated.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses transportation metaphors to explain paradigm differences: procedural's explicit steps, OOP's black-box complexity, and functional programming's lazy evaluation concept, where the final punchline references the advanced concept that functional programs don't execute until results are needed, creating humor through the philosophical paradox of being somewhere before you've arrived."
