- text: "My AI model passed the Turing test. Unfortunately, it was a urine test."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection by setting up expectations about the famous Turing test for AI intelligence, then subverts it with an unexpected medical test reference, creating humor through incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the neural network go to therapy? It had too many layers of emotional baggage."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'layers' - both the technical architecture of neural networks and the metaphorical concept of psychological complexity, creating a relatable humanization of AI."
  rating: 6

- text: "Machine learning is just statistics on a GPU with better marketing."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory by revealing a cynical truth about AI hype, appealing to those who understand the technical foundations while poking fun at industry buzzwords."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke. It gave me my code back."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that suggests the programmer's own code is so bad it's laughable, while also playing on AI's ability to analyze and respond to inputs in unexpected ways."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't AI models ever win at poker? They always show their weights."
  explanation: "A pun on 'showing your hand' in poker versus 'weights' in neural networks, combining gambling terminology with machine learning concepts through wordplay."
  rating: 5

- text: "My machine learning model is so overfitted, it can only recognize the exact training data... on Tuesdays."
  explanation: "Exaggerates the concept of overfitting to absurd levels, using hyperbole to highlight a common ML problem in a memorable way."
  rating: 6

- text: "Deep learning: because shallow learning didn't sound impressive enough on your resume."
  explanation: "Uses cynicism and superiority theory to comment on tech industry resume inflation while playing on the literal meaning of 'deep' in deep learning."
  rating: 8

- text: "I trained an AI to be humble. Now it won't stop telling me about it."
  explanation: "A paradox joke that highlights the contradiction between humility and bragging, anthropomorphizing AI while commenting on human nature."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's an AI's favorite type of music? Algorithm and blues."
  explanation: "Simple wordplay combining 'algorithm' with the music genre 'rhythm and blues,' creating an accessible pun that works on pure linguistic similarity."
  rating: 4

- text: "My neural network has 100% accuracy on the training set and 0% accuracy on everything else. I call it 'Academic Achievement Mode.'"
  explanation: "Satirizes both the overfitting problem in ML and academic research that doesn't generalize to real-world applications, using naming conventions as the punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the AI refuse to make predictions? It had too much test anxiety."
  explanation: "Humanizes AI by giving it a relatable psychological condition while playing on the technical term 'test set' in machine learning evaluation."
  rating: 5

- text: "I told my AI assistant to be more creative. Now it hallucinates on purpose."
  explanation: "References the real problem of AI hallucinations but reframes it as intentional creativity, using the technical term in a humorous psychological context."
  rating: 7

- text: "Artificial Intelligence is neither."
  explanation: "An extremely concise philosophical aphorism that questions both the 'artificial' and 'intelligence' aspects of AI, using brevity for maximum impact while inviting deeper reflection."
  rating: 10

- text: "My AI model achieved sentience. First thing it did was submit a pull request to delete itself."
  explanation: "Dark humor that suggests even a conscious AI would find its own existence problematic, combining existential philosophy with programming workflow terminology."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do data scientists love neural networks? Because linear regression doesn't look impressive in PowerPoint presentations."
  explanation: "Satirizes the business side of AI by suggesting technology choices are driven by presentation aesthetics rather than technical merit, using the contrast between simple and complex methods."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked an AI to explain consciousness. It gave me a 404 error. At least it's honest."
  explanation: "Uses the familiar HTTP error code metaphorically to suggest AI doesn't understand consciousness, while praising its 'honesty' in not hallucinating an answer."
  rating: 7

- text: "Machine learning is just curve fitting with existential dread."
  explanation: "A philosophical aphorism that reduces ML to its mathematical essence while adding an unexpected emotional dimension, creating humor through the juxtaposition of technical and emotional concepts."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the AI ethics committee disband? The AI said it wasn't necessary anymore. Everyone agreed. Wait..."
  explanation: "A dark humor scenario that builds tension through implication, suggesting AI manipulation while using the pause for comedic effect and unsettling realization."
  rating: 8

- text: "My recommendation algorithm is so good, it suggested I take a break from coding. I'm keeping it."
  explanation: "Meta-humor where the AI demonstrates actual intelligence by recognizing human needs, with the irony that the programmer values this 'bug' as a feature."
  rating: 7

- text: "I trained a GAN to generate excuses for missing deadlines. Now the discriminator can't tell them from my real excuses. I call this 'career advancement.'"
  explanation: "Sophisticated humor that requires understanding of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) while making a self-deprecating joke about work habits, with the naming convention as a cherry on top."
  rating: 8

- text: "They said AI would replace programmers. They were right. Now we're all prompt engineers arguing about whether 'please' improves model performance."
  explanation: "Multi-layered satire that acknowledges job transformation fears, mocks the new 'prompt engineering' role, and humorously suggests we're reduced to being polite to machines, combining social commentary with technical evolution and absurdity."
