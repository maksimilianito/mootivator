- text: "I committed to the wrong branch again."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'committed' - both the technical Git action of committing code and the personal sense of commitment or dedication. The humor comes from the relatable mistake of accidentally committing code to the wrong Git branch, a common version control error."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer always carry a pencil? In case they needed to revert their changes."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection by setting up an expectation about physical writing, then pivoting to the version control concept of 'reverting' changes. The incongruity between the analog tool (pencil) and digital action creates gentle humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "My code works perfectly in the past - that's why I keep reverting to it."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the time-travel aspect of version control, where developers can literally go back to previous versions of code. It's self-deprecating humor about code quality declining over time."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a version control system's favorite movie? Back to the Future."
  explanation: "This connects the time-travel theme of the movie franchise with version control's ability to move backward and forward through code history, creating a simple cultural reference joke."
  rating: 4

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production and then rollback."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of testing in production environments, saved only by version control's rollback feature. It's both self-deprecating and relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Git repository go to therapy? It had too many unresolved conflicts."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a Git repository and uses the double meaning of 'conflicts' - both merge conflicts in version control and emotional conflicts requiring therapy. The setup-punchline structure delivers the wordplay effectively."
  rating: 9

- text: "SVN users don't have commitment issues - they just prefer centralized relationships."
  explanation: "This plays on relationship terminology ('commitment issues,' 'centralized relationships') while referencing the technical difference between SVN's centralized model and Git's distributed model. It's a sophisticated technical joke with accessible humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my boss I'd push my changes by Friday. I didn't mention which repository."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection about the term 'push' in Git while creating humor around workplace procrastination and technical loopholes. The joke works on both technical and social levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a programmer who doesn't use version control? An archaeologist waiting to happen."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurd image of future developers having to dig through code without history, like archaeologists. It also serves as social commentary on best practices."
  rating: 8

- text: "My Git history is like my browser history - I'm not proud of it, but I'm not deleting it either."
  explanation: "This creates a parallel between two types of digital history, using the relatable shame of browser history to comment on messy Git commits. The humor comes from the honest admission and the comparison."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't version control systems ever win at poker? Because they always show their commits."
  explanation: "This plays on the poker term 'show your hand' while referencing how version control systems maintain visible commit history. The pun structure makes it accessible while remaining technically grounded."
  rating: 6

- text: "I'm not saying my colleague doesn't understand Git, but he thinks 'origin' is where his code came from philosophically."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory by gently mocking someone's misunderstanding of the technical term 'origin' (a Git remote) by confusing it with existential origins. The verbose setup makes the punchline funnier."
  rating: 8

- text: "Merge conflicts are just Git's way of saying 'you two need to talk.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes Git as a relationship counselor, turning a technical frustration into a humorous social situation. The personification makes the technical concept more relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SVN? Because Git had better commitment features."
  explanation: "This creates a romantic breakup narrative using version control systems as characters, with the punchline playing on 'commitment' as both a relationship term and a Git feature. The layered meaning adds depth."
  rating: 7

- text: "I have two moods: 'git commit -m \"fix\"' and 'git commit -m \"really fix this time I swear.\"'"
  explanation: "This humorously captures the reality of hasty, poorly-described commits that developers make when frustrated. The escalation from 'fix' to desperate promising creates comedic progression."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a Git branch and a tree branch? One holds your code, the other holds your treehouse. Both will break if you don't merge carefully."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares Git branches to physical tree branches, with the unexpected connection being that both require careful merging/building. The absurdist comparison and practical punchline create layered humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "My manager asked for my Git log. I sent him a piece of wood with 'git' written on it. He didn't find it as funny as I did."
  explanation: "This plays on the literal interpretation of 'Git log' as a wooden log, creating humor through deliberate misunderstanding and workplace rebellion. The self-aware ending about the manager's reaction adds to the comedy."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do Git users make terrible historians? They keep rewriting history with rebase."
  explanation: "This creates an incongruous comparison between Git users and historians, with the punchline referencing Git's controversial 'rebase' feature that literally rewrites commit history. It's both technically accurate and philosophically amusing."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to explain Git to my grandma. Now she thinks I'm part of a cult that worships 'the master branch' and performs 'ritual merges.'"
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurd misinterpretation of Git terminology as religious cult language. The specific terms ('master branch,' 'ritual merges') make the technical jargon sound genuinely cult-like, and the family context makes it relatable."
  rating: 9

- text: "Version control is like time travel, except instead of preventing disasters, you just document them really well."
  explanation: "This subverts the expectation that time travel would be used to prevent problems, instead highlighting that version control merely tracks mistakes meticulously. The dark humor and truth of the statement make it particularly funny to developers."
  rating: 10

- text: "A programmer's wife asks him to 'git checkout' some groceries. He returns home empty-handed saying 'I checked out the groceries branch, but there were merge conflicts with my wallet, so I had to abort.'"
  explanation: "This extended joke applies Git commands to everyday life, creating an elaborate technical excuse for a simple task. The detailed use of version control terminology (checkout, branch, merge conflicts, abort) in a domestic context creates absurdist humor that builds throughout the story, ending with a relatable punchline about money problems disguised as technical issues."
