  rating: 8

- text: "I asked when the requirements would be finalized. The product owner laughed, the developers laughed, the requirements document laughed. We deleted the requirements document."
  explanation: "This absurdist escalation mocks the fantasy of stable requirements, ending with the surreal image of the document itself joining the joke before being eliminated."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why don't developers trust pair programming? Because merge conflicts are easier to resolve than personality conflicts."
  explanation: "This contrasts technical and human challenges, suggesting that the social aspects of development are harder than the code itself."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our MVP has been in beta for three years. At this point, the 'M' stands for 'Maybe' and the 'V' for 'Very Not.'"
  explanation: "This wordplay deconstructs the MVP acronym to show how projects get stuck in perpetual beta, never reaching actual viability or minimum status."
  rating: 8

- text: "The architect drew a beautiful system diagram. We built what we understood from it. They're still not the same thing."
  explanation: "This highlights the communication gap between design and implementation, showing how intent and reality diverge despite documentation."

- text: "Our code review process is very thorough: first we approve it, then we deploy it, then we review what went wrong."

- text: "I finally understand DevOps: it's where developers ops for doing operations and operations ops for doing development, and both opt out when things break."
  explanation: "This complex wordplay on 'ops' and 'opt' creates layers of meaning about responsibility avoidance and role confusion in DevOps culture."
