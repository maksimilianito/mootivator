- text: "In 1946, ENIAC used 18,000 vacuum tubes. Today, my laptop uses 18,000 browser tabs."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory by comparing the physical complexity of early computers with modern digital hoarding behavior, highlighting how we've traded physical components for virtual clutter."

- text: "Why did Grace Hopper keep a nanosecond in her pocket? For when executives asked why satellites couldn't work faster!"
  explanation: "This references the legendary computer scientist Grace Hopper who famously used physical representations of nanoseconds (wire lengths) to explain computing speed limitations to non-technical managers."

- text: "The first computer bug was literally a moth. Now bugs are features we haven't documented yet."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'bug' - from the actual moth found in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947 to modern software defects, with a cynical twist about corporate spin."

- text: "Alan Turing broke Enigma. Modern developers break production on a Friday afternoon."
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke contrasting the monumental achievement of cracking Nazi encryption with the common developer mistake of deploying risky changes before the weekend."

- text: "In the 1960s, programmers used punch cards. Today we use Stack Overflow. The cards were more reliable."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor suggesting that despite technological advancement, modern developers' dependency on copied code might be less reliable than old-school methods."

- text: "Why did IBM's Deep Blue beat Kasparov at chess? It never had to debug its opening moves at 3 AM."
  explanation: "Combines the famous 1997 chess match with programmer culture, suggesting the AI's advantage was avoiding the human experience of exhausted late-night coding."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first programmer was Ada Lovelace in 1843. She wrote the first algorithm before computers existed. Modern developers Google algorithms while computers exist."
  explanation: "Uses absurdity and superiority theory to contrast Ada Lovelace's theoretical brilliance with contemporary developers' reliance on search engines."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between the Apollo 11 guidance computer and a modern smartwatch? The watch has more computing power and worse battery life."
  explanation: "Incongruity humor highlighting how technological progress doesn't always mean practical improvement, contrasting moon-landing tech with everyday devices."
  rating: 8

- text: "Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and gave it away for free. Now we pay for the privilege of being tracked on it."
  explanation: "Dark humor using misdirection to contrast the idealistic origins of the web with modern surveillance capitalism reality."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why don't computer historians use Git? Because they prefer their timelines without merge conflicts."
  explanation: "Meta-humor applying modern version control concepts to the study of computing history itself, playing on the complexity of Git's branching model."
  rating: 7

- text: "In 1981, the IBM PC had 16KB of RAM. Today, that's barely enough to store the cookie consent popup."
  explanation: "Absurdity technique contrasting early computing constraints with the bloat of modern web development, specifically targeting annoying GDPR compliance implementations."
  rating: 9

- text: "What did the Xerox PARC engineer say to Steve Jobs? 'You're welcome.' What did Steve Jobs say back? 'Shipped it.'"
  explanation: "References the famous story of Apple 'borrowing' GUI concepts from Xerox, using brevity to highlight the difference between invention and commercialization."
  rating: 8

- text: "The ARPANET connected four computers in 1969. Today, my smart fridge connects to four servers just to tell me I'm out of milk."
  explanation: "Incongruity and absurdity highlighting how the modest origins of the internet contrast with the over-engineered IoT devices of today."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the ENIAC computer so honest? Because it couldn't lie - it only had 20 words of memory, and 19 were taken up by the operating system."
  explanation: "Absurd exaggeration playing on early computer memory limitations while anthropomorphizing the machine, with a subtle dig at OS bloat."
  rating: 6

- text: "Dennis Ritchie created C. Then programmers created C++, C#, and Objective-C. Dennis created a language. We created a family tree that needs therapy."
  explanation: "Uses the metaphor of a dysfunctional family to describe programming language evolution, with meta-humor about the proliferation of C-derived languages."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a 1970s mainframe operator and a modern DevOps engineer? The mainframe operator knew when the job finished."
  explanation: "Sophisticated workplace humor contrasting clear job completion in batch processing with the endless nature of modern continuous deployment and monitoring."
  rating: 10

- text: "Bill Gates said 640KB ought to be enough for anybody. He was right - that's exactly enough RAM to run a single Electron app's splash screen."
  explanation: "Combines a famous (possibly apocryphal) quote with modern criticism of Electron framework bloat, using precise technical exaggeration for comedic effect."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did Linus Torvalds create Git? Because after managing Linux kernel contributions via email patches, even merge conflicts seemed like an improvement."
  explanation: "Relief theory humor referencing the chaotic early days of Linux development, suggesting that even Git's notorious complexity was a step up from the alternative."
  rating: 7

- text: "The 1999 iBook came in five colors. The 2024 MacBook comes in three shades of grey. Turns out the future wasn't colorful - it was just better at marketing depression as 'minimalism.'"
