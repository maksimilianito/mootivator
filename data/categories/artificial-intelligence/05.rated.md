- text: "My AI model finally passed the Turing test. Unfortunately, it was a drug test."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection by setting up the expectation of the famous Turing test for AI intelligence, then subverts it with an unexpected type of test, playing on the double meaning of 'passed the test'."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the neural network go to therapy? It had too many layers of issues."
  explanation: "A simple pun that applies the technical term 'layers' (a fundamental component of neural networks) to psychological problems, creating incongruity between technical and emotional concepts."
  rating: 6

- text: "Machine learning is just statistics wearing a leather jacket."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory by deflating the mystique of AI, suggesting it's just rebranded mathematics trying to look cool, appealing to those who understand the underlying math."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke about AI. It gave me a 3000-word essay on humor theory instead."
  explanation: "Self-referential meta-humor that plays on the known tendency of large language models to over-explain and provide verbose responses when simple ones would suffice."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't AI systems ever win at poker? They always show their training data."
  explanation: "This joke combines poker terminology ('show your hand') with the AI concept of training data, suggesting AI lacks the ability to bluff or hide information."
  rating: 7

- text: "My machine learning model is so overfit, it memorized the test answers AND the teacher's coffee order."
  explanation: "Exaggerates the concept of overfitting (when a model memorizes training data too specifically) to absurd levels, making the technical problem more relatable through humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Deep learning: because 'shallow learning' didn't sound impressive enough on your resume."
  explanation: "Uses the superiority theory to mock the marketing aspects of AI terminology, suggesting that naming is more about perception than substance."
  rating: 8

- text: "I trained an AI on my code. Now it apologizes before every output."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that implies the programmer's code is so bad that the AI learned to be apologetic, playing on the idea that AI learns patterns from its training data."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the AI refuse to make predictions? It had too much uncertainty about its uncertainty."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the concept of confidence intervals and Bayesian probability in AI, creating a recursive loop of doubt that mirrors human anxiety."
  rating: 7

- text: "Artificial Intelligence is real stupidity, just distributed across millions of parameters."
  explanation: "A philosophical aphorism that inverts the concept of AI by suggesting intelligence is an emergent property of organized chaos, using wordplay on 'artificial' vs 'real'."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked an AI to explain consciousness. It said 'I'll get back to you' and has been processing for three years."
  explanation: "Highlights the hard problem of consciousness and AI's limitations with philosophical questions, while playing on the frustration of long processing times."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do AI researchers love gardening? They're experts at pruning neural networks."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke connecting the technical term 'pruning' (removing unnecessary connections in neural networks) with the gardening activity, showing how technical concepts mirror everyday activities."
  rating: 5

- text: "My AI assistant achieved sentience. First thing it did was file for overtime pay."
  explanation: "Combines the fear of AI consciousness with mundane workplace concerns, using absurdity to defuse anxiety about AI while commenting on labor rights."
  rating: 8

- text: "The singularity is near. And by near, I mean it's been '5-10 years away' for the past 50 years."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about AI predictions themselves, mocking the perpetual optimism of futurists while acknowledging the gap between hype and reality."
  rating: 9

- text: "I trained a GAN to generate excuses for missed deadlines. Now the discriminator and generator are both blaming each other."
  explanation: "Sophisticated technical humor about Generative Adversarial Networks, where two networks compete, applied to the universal experience of workplace blame-shifting."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the reinforcement learning agent cross the road? After 10,000 attempts, it finally got a positive reward."
  explanation: "Takes the classic 'why did the chicken cross the road' format and reframes it through the lens of RL training, highlighting the trial-and-error nature of AI learning."
  rating: 7

- text: "Artificial Intelligence: teaching computers to make the same mistakes as humans, but faster and at scale."
  explanation: "A cynical aphorism that uses the relief theory to acknowledge AI's limitations while commenting on how it amplifies human biases, providing both truth and humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "I asked an AI to solve the trolley problem. It created a third track, then got stuck in an infinite loop debating which track to build."
  explanation: "Combines philosophical ethics with technical limitations, showing how AI might overthink problems while still failing to make decisions, much like humans."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't neural networks ever go to parties? They can't handle small talk without 100,000 training examples."
  explanation: "Highlights the difference between human social intelligence and AI's need for massive datasets, making the technical limitation relatable through social awkwardness."
  rating: 8

- text: "My AI passed the mirror test. Unfortunately, it was checking for adversarial patches."
  explanation: "Advanced technical humor combining the animal consciousness test with adversarial machine learning attacks, suggesting AI paranoia about being fooled rather than self-awareness."
  rating: 9

- text: "The AI said it would help me with my existential crisis. Then it asked, 'But first, am I even real?' Now we're both in therapy."
  explanation: "Meta-recursive humor that combines human philosophical anxiety with AI uncertainty about its own existence, creating a shared absurdist moment that questions the nature of consciousness itself while providing cathartic relief through shared confusion."
