  explanation: An extended narrative joke that plays with DevOps concepts (immutable infrastructure, rollbacks) in an afterlife scenario, building tension through the setup and delivering a philosophical punchline about trade-offs.

- text: "DevOps is when your deployment pipeline has more stages than your grief process, but somehow you're still experiencing all five stages every time you push to production: denial that it could break, anger when it does, bargaining with the logs, depression during the incident call, and acceptance as you write the postmortem."
  explanation: A brilliantly layered joke that parallels the five stages of grief with the deployment experience, capturing the emotional journey of DevOps while highlighting the culture of learning from failures through postmortems.

- text: "You know you've achieved true DevOps culture when a developer says 'it works on my machine' and instead of eye-rolls, the operations person replies 'great, let's containerize your machine, version it, ship it through the pipeline, and if it fails in production, we'll debug it together at 2 AM while sharing the on-call pizza.' And somehow, they're both smiling."
  explanation: The ultimate DevOps joke that captures the transformation from adversarial to collaborative culture, incorporating multiple DevOps practices (containerization, version control, CI/CD, shared on-call), while ending on the paradoxical note that shared suffering in a supportive culture is somehow preferable to isolated comfort.
