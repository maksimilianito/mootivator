- text: "My CSS is perfectly centered... on my second monitor."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common frustration of CSS positioning issues, where elements appear correctly on the developer's screen but not where intended. The unexpected twist is that the 'perfect' centering is on the wrong monitor entirely, highlighting the ironic nature of CSS layout challenges."

- text: "Why did the HTML element go to therapy? It had too many unresolved parent issues."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning pattern, where 'parent issues' refers both to psychological problems and to HTML's parent-child element relationships. The joke anthropomorphizes HTML elements while playing on the technical concept of DOM hierarchy."

- text: "JavaScript promises are like New Year's resolutions - they're either pending, fulfilled, or rejected by February."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity by comparing the technical states of JavaScript Promises to the common human experience of abandoning resolutions. It works on multiple levels for both programmers familiar with async operations and general audiences who understand broken resolutions."

- text: "I told my website to be responsive. Now it won't stop asking how I'm feeling."
  explanation: "This exploits the double meaning of 'responsive' - both the technical term for adaptive web design and the emotional quality of being attentive to others' feelings. The misdirection creates humor through the unexpected interpretation."

- text: "My JavaScript is asynchronous, which means my bugs appear whenever they feel like it."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the frustration of async programming where errors can be unpredictable and timing-dependent. The personification of bugs 'feeling like' appearing adds absurdity to a real technical challenge."

- text: "Why don't web developers like nature? Too many bugs and no stack traces."
  explanation: "This uses superiority theory and wordplay, contrasting outdoor 'bugs' with software bugs, while highlighting developers' reliance on debugging tools. It plays on the stereotype of programmers preferring indoor work."

- text: "I finally understood flexbox. Then they released CSS Grid."
  explanation: "This short statement captures the relief theory - the endless cycle of learning in web development where mastering one technology is immediately followed by the need to learn another. The timing creates comedic frustration."

- text: "A web developer walks into a bar, a restaurant, and a caf√©. He was testing his navigation menu."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic 'walks into a bar' joke format by providing a technical explanation. The misdirection from expecting a punchline to receiving a logical development task creates the humor."

- text: "My website loads in 3 seconds. Unfortunately, that's just the cookie consent banner."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the modern web's ironic situation where privacy features become performance problems. The incongruity between fast loading and poor user experience creates humor through frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the div break up with the span? It needed more space."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'space' - both relationship terminology and CSS spacing properties. The anthropomorphization of HTML elements creates a relatable scenario with technical underpinnings."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code in production, but when I do, it's because staging is down."
  explanation: "This adapts the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format to express the dangerous but common practice of production testing. The self-deprecating humor acknowledges a universal developer experience."

- text: "What's a web developer's favorite tea? Responsivi-tea."
  explanation: "A simple pun combining 'responsibility' or 'responsive' with 'tea'. While groan-worthy, it demonstrates how technical terms can be playfully manipulated for wordplay humor."

- text: "My CSS has more !important flags than a military parade."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration and metaphor to highlight the code smell of overusing !important declarations. The military imagery creates an absurd visual that emphasizes the anti-pattern."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the website go to the doctor? It had a bad case of the 404s."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes websites while using the medical metaphor pattern. The '404' error becomes a disease, making a technical problem relatable through familiar health terminology."
  rating: 5

- text: "I spent 3 hours debugging my code. The problem was a missing semicolon in my CSS. I don't use semicolons in CSS anymore. Now I have different problems."
  explanation: "This story-format joke builds through a logical progression that ends in absurdity. It captures the developer experience of solving one problem only to create others, using specific technical details for authenticity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Web accessibility means making sure your website works for everyone. Including Internet Explorer users. Just kidding, even we have limits."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the tension between accessibility ideals and practical limitations. The misdirection from noble principle to harsh reality creates humor through the relief of acknowledging a shared frustration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do web developers prefer dark mode? Because they're still trying to figure out why their light-themed site looks different on every browser."
  explanation: "This combines the common dark mode preference with the real frustration of cross-browser compatibility. The joke suggests developers avoid the problem rather than solve it, creating self-deprecating humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "My portfolio website has a loading animation. It's been loading since 2019. I call it 'job security through perpetual development.'"
  explanation: "This uses self-deprecating humor and absurdity to comment on the perfectionism that prevents developers from finishing personal projects. The meta-humor of calling incomplete work 'job security' adds another layer."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between HTML and HTML5? About 5 years of arguing whether we need semantic tags."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection - instead of explaining technical differences, it comments on the community debates that accompanied HTML5's adoption. The meta-humor about technology adoption cycles resonates with experienced developers."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a recursive function to improve my website's performance. Now it's stuck in an infinite loop of optimization. The page loads instantly, but it never stops loading."
  explanation: "This joke creates a logical paradox where the solution becomes the problem. The absurdity of simultaneously loading instantly and never finishing captures the sometimes contradictory nature of web optimization."

- text: "A product manager, a designer, and a developer walk into a meeting about a 'simple' button. Three hours later, they've debated 47 different shades of blue, discussed the philosophical implications of rounded corners, and the developer has quietly implemented it in gray while they argued. The button still isn't in production because no one approved the pull request."
  explanation: "This extended joke captures the entire web development ecosystem's dysfunction through a familiar scenario. It builds through escalating absurdity, touches multiple pain points (design debates, implementation, deployment), and ends with an anticlimax that any developer recognizes. The specificity of '47 shades' and the developer's passive rebellion add layers of authenticity that make it resonate deeply with the audience."
