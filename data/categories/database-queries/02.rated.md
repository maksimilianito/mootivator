- text: "My first JOIN query returned 10,000 rows when I expected 10. Turns out I forgot the WHERE clause."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common beginner mistake of performing a Cartesian product (cross join) by forgetting to specify join conditions, resulting in exponentially more results than expected. The humor comes from the relatable experience of database query mistakes and the dramatic difference between expectation and reality."

- text: "Why did the database administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud database."
  explanation: "This is a simple pun playing on the literal interpretation of 'cloud' in cloud databases. The physical ladder for a metaphorical cloud creates an incongruity between technical terminology and physical reality."
  rating: 4

- text: "I asked the database for a date. It gave me a timestamp instead."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'date' - both as a romantic outing and as a data type in databases. The database's literal interpretation creates humor through the misdirection pattern."
  rating: 6

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- 0 rows returned"
  explanation: "This self-deprecating SQL joke suggests that querying for users with any clue returns nothing, implying either the users or the person writing the query lacks understanding. The technical format adds authenticity while the comment reveals the punchline."
  rating: 8

- text: "My database relationships are more stable than my personal ones."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the double meaning of 'relationships' - both as database foreign key relationships and personal romantic relationships. The comparison creates humor through the superiority theory, with self-deprecation about one's personal life."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't SQL queries ever get lonely? They always have JOIN company."
  explanation: "A straightforward pun on the SQL JOIN operation and the phrase 'join company' meaning to have companionship. The anthropomorphization of queries adds to the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "I tried to optimize my query, but now it runs so fast I can't tell if it's working."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that successful optimization can create a new problem - the inability to observe the process. It reflects the real frustration of debugging highly optimized code."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's a database administrator's favorite type of music? Table Rock."
  explanation: "A pun combining 'table' (database tables) with 'rock' music, creating the fictional genre 'Table Rock.' Simple wordplay that requires basic database knowledge."
  rating: 3

- text: "My query walked into a bar, two tables, and a view. It left with a hangover and a Cartesian product."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic 'walks into a bar' setup but substitutes database objects (tables, views). The punchline references the dreaded Cartesian product, suggesting the query made poor decisions like someone drinking too much."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my queries in production, but when I do, I use SELECT *."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme while highlighting two major database sins: testing in production and using SELECT * (which retrieves all columns inefficiently). The combination of bad practices creates humor through exaggeration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the LEFT JOIN feel insecure? Because it kept returning NULL values from the right table."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a LEFT JOIN operation, which returns all records from the left table even when there are no matches in the right table (resulting in NULLs). The 'insecurity' mirrors human emotional responses to rejection."
  rating: 7

- text: "My database has commitment issues. Every time I try to COMMIT, it wants to ROLLBACK."
  explanation: "This uses database transaction terminology (COMMIT and ROLLBACK) as a metaphor for relationship commitment problems. The double meaning creates humor while accurately describing database behavior during failed transactions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A SQL query walks into a NoSQL bar. It immediately leaves because it couldn't find a table."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the fundamental difference between SQL (relational, table-based) and NoSQL (document-based, no tables) databases. The query's literal need for a table creates the incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours optimizing a query that runs once a month. My manager asked about my priorities. I told him they were perfectly indexed."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the common problem of premature optimization while making a pun on 'priorities' and database indexes. The humor comes from the absurdity of over-optimizing rarely-used queries and the clever wordplay in the response."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do database queries make terrible comedians? Their timing is always off, and they keep returning unexpected results."
  explanation: "This joke works on multiple levels: queries often have performance issues (timing), they can return unexpected data (bugs), and comedians need good timing. The parallel between query problems and failed comedy creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "I wrote a recursive query to find all my ancestors. It's still running. I think I'm descended from an infinite loop."
  explanation: "This combines genealogy research with recursive SQL queries (Common Table Expressions). The punchline suggests the query will never complete, implying the person is literally descended from programming concepts - an absurd but clever connection."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's queries? The junior's query returns wrong data quickly. The senior's query returns wrong data quickly AND is properly formatted."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke suggests that experience doesn't prevent bugs, just makes them prettier. It plays on the superiority theory while actually showing humility about the universal nature of programming mistakes."
  rating: 9

- text: "My database administrator told me to normalize my tables. Now my data has anxiety and sees a therapist twice a week."
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly conflates database normalization (organizing data to reduce redundancy) with psychological normalization (being mentally healthy). The absurd image of data in therapy creates humor through extreme anthropomorphization."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my database why it was so slow. It said, 'Have you seen my indexes lately? I'm searching through everything like it's 1999.'"
  explanation: "This personifies the database complaining about missing indexes, which cause full table scans (searching everything). The '1999' reference adds a temporal element, suggesting outdated methods, and references the Prince song for additional cultural humor."

- text: "A DBA walks into a bar and sees two tables. He immediately thinks, 'I should JOIN them.' The bartender says, 'Sir, those are for sitting.' The DBA replies, 'Not with that attitude. Watch me create a relationship.'"
  explanation: "This extended joke uses the setup of physical bar tables versus database tables. The DBA's inability to see the real world without database concepts creates humor, and the punchline about 'creating a relationship' works both literally (database foreign keys) and metaphorically (social connections)."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the subquery break up with the main query? It felt like it was only being used for its values, wrapped in parentheses, and never allowed to stand on its own. The main query responded, 'But I made you DISTINCT!' The subquery shot back, 'You only did that to eliminate my duplicates, not celebrate my uniqueness.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke anthropomorphizes SQL queries as a dysfunctional relationship. It uses multiple database concepts (subqueries, DISTINCT, duplicates) as metaphors for emotional issues. The wordplay on 'DISTINCT' meaning both unique in SQL and special in relationships, plus the clever observation about 'eliminating duplicates' versus 'celebrating uniqueness,' creates layered humor that works on both technical and emotional levels."
