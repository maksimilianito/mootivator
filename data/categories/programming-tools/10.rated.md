- text: "My IDE's autocomplete is so aggressive, it finishes my sentences before I even think them."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common experience of overly eager autocomplete features in modern IDEs that sometimes suggest completions too quickly or inappropriately, creating a mild incongruity between helpful and intrusive behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to use Notepad? Because it didn't support his emotional needs."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection - the audience expects a technical reason (like syntax highlighting or plugins), but instead gets an absurd emotional reason, anthropomorphizing the relationship between developer and editor."
  rating: 7

- text: "I switched to Vim. Now I can't exit my relationships either."
  explanation: "This references the infamous difficulty of exiting Vim (a text editor), applying this technical frustration to personal life situations, creating humor through the incongruity of comparing software commands to human relationships."

- text: "Why do developers love VS Code? Because it's the only thing in their life that actually listens to their extensions."

  rating: 8

- text: "I told my IDE I needed space. It gave me whitespace errors instead."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'space' - both personal space in relationships and literal whitespace in code - with the IDE misunderstanding the human need as a formatting issue."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code editor has more themes than my life has meaning."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke contrasts the abundance of cosmetic customization options in modern editors with existential emptiness, using superiority theory through self-mockery."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer break up with their IDE? Too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'unresolved issues' (referring to code problems or bug tracker items) as a double meaning for relationship problems, creating humor through the parallel between technical and emotional contexts."
  rating: 6

- text: "I spent three hours configuring my development environment. I wrote zero lines of code. This is called 'productivity.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common developer trap of endless tool customization at the expense of actual work, using irony to point out the contradiction between activity and productivity."

- text: "Emacs users don't need a window manager. Emacs IS the window manager. And the operating system. And their entire life."

  rating: 9

- text: "I use dark mode not because it saves battery, but because my code looks better when you can't see it clearly."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke subverts the common justifications for dark mode (battery life, eye strain) with an admission of code quality issues, using misdirection to deliver the punchline."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer install fifty plugins? Because the IDE came with forty-nine problems, and now they have ninety-eight."
  explanation: "This references Jay-Z's '99 Problems' while illustrating the paradox that solutions (plugins) often create more problems than they solve, using mathematical progression for comedic effect."
  rating: 9

- text: "Git GUI clients are for developers who want to click their way through merge conflicts like they're playing Minesweeper with their career."
  explanation: "This uses vivid imagery to compare the risky nature of resolving merge conflicts through a graphical interface to the random danger of Minesweeper, creating humor through exaggerated consequences and absurd comparison."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my IDE for help. It suggested I refactor my entire life. Honestly, not wrong."
  explanation: "This starts with a technical request but escalates to life advice, creating humor through the unexpected wisdom of a code suggestion, while the acceptance of this advice adds a layer of self-awareness."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do developers spend more time choosing their IDE theme than their career path? Because at least the theme changes are reversible."
  explanation: "This joke uses contrast between trivial and important decisions while providing a darkly humorous justification - the fear of commitment and irreversibility in major life choices makes trivial customization more appealing."
  rating: 8

- text: "My IDE crashed and took my unsaved work. I'm not saying it's personal, but it made eye contact first."
  explanation: "This absurdly anthropomorphizes the IDE as having malicious intent, creating humor through the paranoid attribution of consciousness and deliberate cruelty to software bugs, escalating a technical problem to a personal betrayal."
  rating: 8

- text: "Real developers don't use IDEs. They use butterflies. They open their wings and the disturbances in the air flow cause the computer to flip the right bits. It's very zen."
  explanation: "This is an escalating absurdity joke that parodies elitism in developer tool choices, taking the 'hardcore developer' stereotype to its logical extreme with a reference to the XKCD comic about text editor superiority, creating humor through complete departure from reality while maintaining deadpan delivery."
  rating: 10

- text: "I've been using the same IDE for ten years. Not by choice - I just still can't figure out how to close all the tabs from that first project."
  explanation: "This combines technical truth (IDE tab management can be overwhelming), learned helplessness, and the passage of time to create a absurd scenario where a simple task becomes an insurmountable decade-long problem, using exaggeration and self-deprecation to highlight the feature bloat and complexity of modern development environments."
