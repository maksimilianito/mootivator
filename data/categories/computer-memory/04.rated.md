- text: "I tried to clear my cache, but now I can't remember why."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'cache' as both computer memory and the concept of remembering things. Clearing cache removes stored data, creating an incongruity between the technical action and its humorous application to human memory."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the RAM go to therapy? It had too many issues to address."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'address' which in computing refers to memory locations, while also meaning to deal with problems. The setup-punchline structure creates humor through the double meaning of technical terminology."
  rating: 7

- text: "My computer's memory is like my attention span—volatile and easily lost."
  explanation: "This joke compares volatile RAM (which loses data when power is off) to human attention span, using the technical term 'volatile' in both its computing and everyday meaning to create relatable humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Stack overflow isn't just an error—it's my brain after reading documentation."
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of stack overflow (when memory allocation exceeds capacity) to the human experience of information overload, creating humor through the relatable comparison."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't programmers trust their memory? Because it's always getting corrupted by reality."
  explanation: "This plays on memory corruption (a technical issue) and applies it metaphorically to how reality conflicts with a programmer's expectations, using the superiority theory of self-deprecating humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "I have 32GB of RAM, but my brain still runs out of memory during meetings."
  explanation: "This creates incongruity by comparing abundant computer memory with the human experience of mental fatigue, highlighting the absurdity that more RAM doesn't help with boring meetings."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of memory? The one that doesn't leak."
  explanation: "This references memory leaks (a common programming bug where memory isn't properly released) and presents it as a desirable trait, using misdirection to create humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code has great memory management—it forgets everything equally."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the expectation of 'great memory management' by describing the opposite (forgetting everything), using irony to highlight poor programming practices in a self-deprecating way."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the garbage collector break up with the programmer? Too much emotional baggage to deallocate."
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of garbage collection (automatic memory management) to relationships, using the term 'deallocate' to create a double meaning between freeing memory and ending emotional attachments."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't have a photographic memory—more like a buffer that needs constant flushing."
  explanation: "This compares human memory to a computer buffer (temporary storage), using the technical term 'flushing' to describe forgetting things, creating humor through self-deprecation and technical accuracy."
  rating: 8

- text: "Cache invalidation: because sometimes forgetting is the hardest problem in computer science."
  explanation: "This references Phil Karlton's famous quote about cache invalidation being one of the hardest problems in CS, adding a philosophical twist about the difficulty of properly forgetting or clearing stored data."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to upgrade his RAM? He was too attached to his old memories."
  explanation: "This creates a pun on 'memories' referring to both RAM and sentimental memories, using the misdirection pattern where 'attached' works both technically and emotionally."
  rating: 7

- text: "My memory management strategy is simple: malloc everything and hope for the best."
  explanation: "This uses technical terminology (malloc - memory allocation in C) to describe terrible programming practice, creating humor through exaggerated incompetence and the relief theory of acknowledging common bad habits."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a programmer who never frees memory? An optimist who believes in infinite resources."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the absurdity of memory leaks by reframing poor programming as naive optimism, using the superiority theory to gently mock bad practices while remaining relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my computer to download more RAM. It laughed in segmentation fault."
  explanation: "This references the infamous 'download more RAM' scam while incorporating a segmentation fault (memory access error), creating layered humor that works on multiple technical levels."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do programmers confuse Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25, and their memory addresses are just as confusing."
  explanation: "This extends the classic octal/decimal joke (Oct 31 = Dec 25 in different bases) by adding a layer about memory addresses being equally confusing, creating meta-humor about programming confusion itself."
  rating: 6

- text: "My cache hit rate is like my success rate at predictions—surprisingly low despite all the storage."
  explanation: "This applies the technical metric of cache hit rate (how often data is found in cache) to human prediction accuracy, creating humor through the paradox of having lots of stored information but poor results."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a programmer's memory and their RAM? One forgets semicolons, the other forgets everything when you turn it off."
  explanation: "This creates a comparison between human forgetfulness (missing semicolons - a common error) and volatile memory, using parallel structure and the incongruity of comparing two different types of 'forgetting.'"
  rating: 8

- text: "I practice defensive programming: I allocate memory, then immediately forget where I put it."
  explanation: "This subverts 'defensive programming' (a best practice) by describing the exact opposite behavior (memory leaks), using irony and self-deprecation to create humor about common programming mistakes."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the memory allocator go to anger management? It had serious boundary issues."
  explanation: "This creates brilliant wordplay on 'boundary issues' which in computing refers to buffer overflows and memory access violations, while psychologically referring to personal space problems, working perfectly on both levels."
  rating: 10

- text: "They say memory is cheap, but my therapist charges $200 an hour to help me forget my production bugs."
  explanation: "This joke creates a sophisticated comparison between cheap computer RAM and expensive therapy, using the double meaning of 'memory' and 'forgetting' to comment on the psychological toll of programming errors, combining technical knowledge with dark humor about developer stress."
