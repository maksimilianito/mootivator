- text: "Python developers don't get cold—they just import heat."
  explanation: "A simple play on Python's 'import' statement, suggesting that programmers solve real-world problems with code syntax. The humor comes from applying programming logic to physical reality."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: "A classic pun combining the visual impairment concept with programming language names (C# pronounced 'C sharp'). Works on the double meaning of 'see' and the language name."
  rating: 7

- text: "Rust developers: where the compiler is your therapist and your worst enemy."
  explanation: "References Rust's notoriously strict compiler that catches errors but can be frustrating. The incongruity of a compiler serving two opposite roles creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes a SQL query and uses the technical term 'JOIN' in its social context. The setup-punchline structure applies database operations to a bar scenario."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer go broke? Because he lost his cache and couldn't find his closure."
  explanation: "Double wordplay using 'cache' (both money and browser storage) and 'closure' (both emotional resolution and JavaScript concept). Multiple layers of meaning create sophisticated humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "C++ is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, and everyone thinks everyone else is doing it."
  explanation: "A provocative but work-safe comparison that highlights the gap between C++'s reputation and actual mastery. Uses the superiority theory by suggesting widespread incompetence."
  rating: 8

- text: "Assembly language: because sometimes you need to tell your computer exactly how to be stupid."
  explanation: "Inverts the expectation that low-level languages provide more control by suggesting they reveal the computer's fundamental limitations. The absurdity creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do functional programmers avoid relationships? Too many side effects."
  explanation: "Applies functional programming's core principle (avoiding side effects) to romantic relationships. The technical concept perfectly maps to real-world complications."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer's spouse says: 'Go to the store and buy a loaf of bread. If they have eggs, buy a dozen.' The programmer returns with 12 loaves of bread because they had eggs."
  explanation: "Classic misdirection joke showing how programmers interpret instructions literally, like a computer would. The ambiguous 'buy a dozen' creates the unexpected outcome."
  rating: 10

- text: "PHP: the only language where you can write '$$$$$' and wonder if it's a syntax error or just your variable naming convention."
  explanation: "Mocks PHP's loose syntax rules and the dollar sign variable prefix. The absurdity of multiple dollar signs being potentially valid code creates humor through exaggeration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do Haskell programmers always look confused? They're still trying to understand their own code from yesterday."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about Haskell's abstract nature and steep learning curve. Suggests that even experts struggle with the language's complexity."
  rating: 7

- text: "In Python, everything is an object. In JavaScript, everything is an object. In C, you are the object."
  explanation: "Escalating comparison that ends with an unexpected twist—in C, the programmer becomes objectified by the language's demands. Uses pattern disruption for comedic effect."
  rating: 9

- text: "COBOL programmers never die. They're just too expensive to terminate."
  explanation: "References the scarcity of COBOL programmers maintaining legacy systems and their high salaries. The double meaning of 'terminate' (employment and program execution) adds depth."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Go developer refuse to handle errors? They were in denial—wait, no, they just forgot to check."
  explanation: "Mocks Go's explicit error handling requirement that developers often forget. The self-correcting structure mimics the debugging process itself."
  rating: 7

- text: "Scala: for when you want to write Java but also want to feel intellectually superior at parties."
  explanation: "Combines superiority theory with cultural commentary about Scala developers. The absurdity of programming languages as social status symbols creates humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A Lisp programmer walks into a bar. ((The bartender says) (What'll you have?)) (The programmer says) (((())((()()())())))"
  explanation: "Visual joke using Lisp's excessive parentheses notation to represent increasingly nested, incomprehensible responses. The absurdity escalates with each level of nesting."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do TypeScript developers sleep well at night? Because they know exactly what type of nightmare they're having."
  explanation: "Paradoxical joke suggesting TypeScript's type safety extends even to negative experiences. The unexpected application of types to dreams creates absurdist humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Perl: write once, read never. Not even by yourself. Especially not by yourself."
  explanation: "Escalating criticism of Perl's infamous readability problems. The self-referential twist—that even the author can't read their own code—heightens the absurdity."
  rating: 8

- text: "A C developer and a Rust developer walk into a memory leak. Only one walks out, and it's definitely not the one who thought 'free()' was optional."
  explanation: "Dark humor about memory management, contrasting C's manual approach with Rust's safety. The morbid metaphor of a memory leak as a physical danger creates unexpected imagery."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Ruby developer break up with Python? They said, 'You're beautiful, but I need someone who appreciates my blocks.' Python replied, 'I have decorators.' Ruby whispered, 'It's not the same,' and walked away crying in elegant, expressive syntax."
  explanation: "Elaborate anthropomorphization of programming languages having a relationship drama. References actual technical differences (Ruby blocks vs Python decorators) while creating an absurdly emotional narrative that mirrors human relationships."
  rating: 10

- text: "Brainfuck is proof that God has a sense of humor, and that sense of humor is watching developers try to explain their career choices to their parents."
  explanation: "Meta-humor combining the absurdity of esoteric programming languages with the real-world social awkwardness of explaining programming. The multi-layered joke works on technical, social, and existential levels simultaneously."
