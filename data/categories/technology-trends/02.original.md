- text: "My company just upgraded to the latest framework. I'm still reading the documentation for the previous one."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the frustrating pace of technological change where developers struggle to keep up, with new versions and frameworks releasing faster than they can learn the current ones. The incongruity lies in the impossibility of ever being 'current.'"

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to learn the new JavaScript framework? Because by the time he finished the tutorial, it would be deprecated."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure to exaggerate the rapid turnover of JavaScript frameworks, a common pain point in web development. The humor comes from the relatable frustration of investing time in learning something that quickly becomes obsolete."

- text: "Our tech stack is so cutting-edge, the documentation doesn't exist yet."
  explanation: "This one-liner plays on the double meaning of 'cutting-edge' - both innovative and so new it's impractical. The absurdity of having technology without documentation creates humor through exaggeration of a real problem."

- text: "I finally mastered Angular. My boss said 'Great! Now learn React, Vue, and Svelte by Monday.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke uses misdirection - the expectation of praise is subverted by an overwhelming new demand. It reflects the reality of modern web development where knowing one framework is never enough."

- text: "What's the half-life of a technology skill? About six months, or one job interview, whichever comes first."
  explanation: "This applies scientific terminology (half-life) to the decay of technical knowledge relevance. The humor comes from the uncomfortable truth that skills become outdated rapidly, with the added twist that job interviews expose this obsolescence."

- text: "My resume says 'Experienced in legacy technologies.' I wrote it last year."
  explanation: "This short joke uses temporal irony - what was current technology becomes 'legacy' almost immediately. The self-deprecating humor highlights how quickly the industry moves, making recent experience seem ancient."

- text: "Why don't programmers like history class? Because they're too busy living in the future while debugging the past."
  explanation: "This plays with temporal paradox - developers simultaneously work with outdated code (the past) while adopting bleeding-edge tech (the future), never actually existing in the present moment. The wordplay on 'debugging the past' adds technical flavor."

- text: "I used to be a full-stack developer. Now I'm a full-stack archaeologist."
  explanation: "This joke transforms a job title into something unexpected, suggesting that working with even recent technology feels like excavating ancient artifacts. The superiority theory applies as developers mock their own predicament."

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer. And that someone just deprecated your API."
  explanation: "This builds on a famous tech aphorism and adds a punchline about the instability of cloud services. The humor comes from the double incongruity - first demystifying 'the cloud,' then adding the frustration of breaking changes."

- text: "What's the difference between a tech trend and a tech fad? About three venture capital funding rounds."
  explanation: "This joke uses a question-answer format to satirize how financial backing, rather than merit, often determines whether technology gains traction. It's a commentary on the business side of innovation."

- text: "I wrote code that's future-proof. It doesn't work now either."
  explanation: "This short quip uses logical misdirection - 'future-proof' usually means sustainable and adaptable, but here it means 'equally broken in all time periods.' The self-deprecating humor makes it relatable."

- text: "Our company adopted microservices. Now we have micro-problems in every service."
  explanation: "This plays on the wordplay between 'microservices' (an architectural pattern) and 'micro-problems,' suggesting that new technology doesn't eliminate problems but distributes them differently. It's a commentary on how trends don't always solve what they promise."

- text: "Why did the startup pivot to AI? Because their original product was just a form with validation, and investors don't fund those anymore."
  explanation: "This longer joke satirizes the trend-chasing nature of tech startups, where adding 'AI' to anything becomes necessary for funding regardless of actual need. It exposes the gap between innovation and marketing."

- text: "I'm not saying technology moves fast, but my 'What's New' bookmark folder is now historical fiction."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor and exaggeration to illustrate how quickly tech news becomes outdated. The category confusion (tech news becoming fiction/history) creates humor through absurdity."

- text: "How do you know if a technology is mature? When the people who created it start warning others not to use it."
  explanation: "This reverses expectations - maturity usually implies stability and recommendation, but here it suggests the creators have learned hard lessons. It's a meta-commentary on how innovators often regret their creations."

- text: "My code is blockchain-based, AI-powered, and cloud-native. It prints 'Hello World.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses extreme incongruity between the impressive technical buzzwords and the trivial output. It mocks the trend of over-engineering simple solutions and using trendy terminology without substance."

- text: "What's the leading cause of death for programming languages? Being called 'the next big thing.'"
  explanation: "This dark humor applies medical terminology to technology lifecycle. The irony is that excessive hype often leads to backlash and abandonment, making the 'blessing' of popularity actually a curse."

- text: "I finally understand quantum computing. Just kidding - it both makes sense and doesn't make sense until someone asks me to explain it."
  explanation: "This applies the quantum superposition concept to understanding itself, creating recursive humor. It mocks the trend of everyone claiming to understand complex emerging technologies while actually being confused."

- text: "Why did the developer go to therapy? His imposter syndrome had imposter syndrome - he felt like a fraud for thinking he was a fraud about knowing the latest tech."
  explanation: "This creates recursive, meta-humor by applying imposter syndrome to itself. It captures the anxiety of keeping up with rapid technological change and the psychological toll of feeling perpetually behind."

- text: "I asked ChatGPT about the next big technology trend. It said 'Me, but newer.' Then it deprecated itself."
  explanation: "This meta-joke has AI commenting on its own obsolescence, creating multiple layers of irony. It's self-referential humor about AI trends while being delivered as an AI-generated joke, and includes the absurdist element of self-deprecation."

- text: "A programmer time-travels to 2030 and asks what technology everyone uses. They reply: 'JavaScript frameworks.' He asks which one. They look confused and say 'What do you mean which one? There are forty-seven thousand to choose from. We're down from last year.'"
  explanation: "This extended joke uses science fiction setup to exaggerate the JavaScript framework proliferation problem to absurdist levels. The punchline has multiple layers - the impossibly high number, the fact it's actually a decrease, and the casual acceptance of this chaos. It's the culmination of technology trend humor, combining temporal irony, exaggeration, and resigned acceptance of an accelerating problem."
