- text: "Code reviews: where everyone's a critic, but nobody wants their code criticized."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony to highlight the common human tendency to be more comfortable giving feedback than receiving it, a universal truth that manifests particularly strongly in code review processes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do developers love code reviews? They finally get to use their English degree."
  explanation: "This plays on the stereotype that programming is purely technical, when in reality code reviews require extensive written communication skills, creating an unexpected connection between humanities and technical work."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code reviewer asked for 'just a few small changes.' I'm now rewriting the entire application."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to capture the common experience of scope creep in code reviews, where seemingly minor feedback cascades into major refactoring work."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code review status: 'Looks good to me' translated means 'I didn't actually read it but the build passed.'"
  explanation: "This exposes the gap between the formal process of code review and the reality of time-pressed developers, using the misdirection pattern where the literal meaning differs from actual practice."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the code review take three weeks? Because 'async' doesn't just describe the code."
  explanation: "This employs wordplay on 'async' (asynchronous programming) to describe the delayed, non-real-time nature of the review process itself, creating a double meaning."
  rating: 9

- text: "I approve all code reviews immediately. I'm not helpful, I'm just optimistic."
  explanation: "This uses self-deprecating humor to highlight the tension between being a supportive teammate and providing meaningful feedback, presenting negligence as misplaced positivity."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a code review and a therapy session? In therapy, you pay someone to tell you what's wrong with you."
  explanation: "This comparison joke creates unexpected parallels between emotional vulnerability in therapy and technical vulnerability in code reviews, with the punchline being that code reviews provide this service for free."
  rating: 8

- text: "My pull request has been open so long, the technology stack is now considered legacy."
  explanation: "This hyperbole captures the frustration of waiting for code review approval by exaggerating the passage of time to absurd proportions, playing on how quickly technology evolves."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code reviewer's dilemma: Approve bad code and feel guilty, or suggest changes and become the villain."
  explanation: "This presents the no-win situation reviewers face, using the superiority theory to acknowledge the social dynamics that make honest feedback difficult despite being the reviewer's job."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do code reviews feel like performance art? Because everyone's watching, nobody understands it, and the creator is having an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This extended comparison uses the misdirection pattern to equate the public nature of code reviews with avant-garde performance, highlighting the vulnerability developers feel."
  rating: 10

- text: "I left 47 comments on a code review. The developer left one comment back: 'Who hurt you?'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke uses role reversal where the reviewer becomes the reviewed, suggesting that excessive criticism reveals more about the critic than the code."
  rating: 10

- text: "Code review drinking game: Take a shot every time someone says 'this is just a suggestion.' You'll be sober, because everyone knows it's mandatory."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-misdirection-resolution pattern to expose the passive-aggressive language of code reviews where politeness masks requirement, with the twist that the drinking game doesn't work."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code passed review with no comments. Now I'm worried I didn't push the right branch."
  explanation: "This captures the paradoxical anxiety where success feels more suspicious than criticism, playing on developers' imposter syndrome and the expectation that all code has flaws."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why are code reviews like restaurant reviews? One star means 'it works,' five stars means 'I wrote it.'"
  explanation: "This comparison exposes bias in the review process through the familiar context of restaurant ratings, suggesting that personal investment corrupts objectivity in predictable ways."
  rating: 8

- text: "Senior developer's code review: 'Interesting approach.' Junior developer's translation: 'Start over, and this time, read the documentation.'"
  explanation: "This highlights the coded language of professional feedback where politeness obscures directness, requiring translation between what's said and what's meant, creating a linguistic incongruity."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't always write perfect code, but when I do, my reviewer finds the one variable I named 'thingy.'"
  explanation: "This uses the 'most interesting man' meme format to capture Murphy's Law in code reviews, where the one embarrassing shortcut always gets discovered despite otherwise excellent work."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code review phases: 1) This is fine. 2) This is not fine. 3) I'm not fine. 4) Let's discuss this offline."
  explanation: "This progressive structure traces the emotional journey of a contentious review, using escalation and the final euphemism 'offline' to indicate when written communication has completely broken down."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the developer bring a lawyer to the code review? Because every comment started with 'Technically...'"
  explanation: "This absurdist joke exaggerates the pedantic nature of some code reviews where reviewers focus on technical minutiae, suggesting the process has become adversarial litigation rather than collaboration."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code reviewer wrote 'Have you considered' followed by the exact solution I implemented. Yes, I considered it so hard I coded it."
  explanation: "This exposes the frustration when reviewers don't fully understand the code before commenting, creating a situation where they suggest what already exists, highlighting the importance of thorough review."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code review best practice: Write your comments like you're defusing a bomb—carefully, specifically, and with the assumption that one wrong word will cause an explosion."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares the delicate social dynamics of giving feedback to bomb disposal, using absurdist escalation to emphasize how carefully reviewers must phrase criticism to avoid conflict."
  rating: 9

- text: "How many developers does it take to approve a pull request? Five: one to say LGTM, one to request changes, one to approve anyway, one to revert it later, and one to write a postmortem about why we need better code review processes."
  explanation: "This 'how many does it take' joke format creates a complete narrative arc of code review dysfunction, where each participant undermines the others, ultimately requiring meta-analysis of the failed process itself—a recursive commentary on the difficulty of implementing effective peer review."
