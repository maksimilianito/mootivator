- text: "Python developers think whitespace is sacred. C developers think it's just wasted memory."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the fundamental difference between Python's whitespace-significant syntax and C's more compact, whitespace-agnostic approach, highlighting how language design philosophies shape developer attitudes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: "A simple pun using the misdirection pattern, playing on the double meaning of 'see' and the programming language 'C#', while referencing Java's verbosity stereotype."
  rating: 5

- text: "A JavaScript developer walks into a bar. The bartender says 'We don't serve your type here.' The developer says 'That's okay, I'm dynamically typed anyway.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the setup-punchline structure to contrast JavaScript's dynamic typing with the bartender's rejection, turning a negative into a language feature celebration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Rust developers: 'My code is memory-safe!' C developers: 'My code is fast!' Python developers: 'My code runs.'"
  explanation: "This joke employs the superiority theory by establishing a hierarchy of priorities, with the punchline showing Python developers' modest expectations, subverting the competitive escalation."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't PHP developers ever win arguments? Because they always get stuck in the middle of the stack."
  explanation: "A wordplay on PHP's traditional role as a middle-tier language and the phrase 'stuck in the middle,' referencing PHP's often-criticized position in web development."
  rating: 6

- text: "Go developer: 'Where's your try-catch?' Rust developer: 'Where's your borrow checker?'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the different error-handling philosophies, with each language's advocates questioning the other's approach to safety and error management."
  rating: 7

- text: "A C++ developer died and went to heaven. God asked, 'What's your greatest sin?' The developer replied, 'Multiple inheritance.' God said, 'You're going to Hell.' The developer said, 'At least there I can use goto.'"
  explanation: "This joke layers multiple programming taboos (multiple inheritance, goto statements) within a narrative framework, using the absurdity technique to exaggerate language war debates."
  rating: 9

- text: "Ruby developers write poetry. Python developers write prose. Perl developers write ransom notes."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses metaphor to characterize each language's syntax aesthetics, with the punchline delivering an unexpected and humorous take on Perl's notorious readability issues."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the Haskell developer refuse to go to the party? Because side effects weren't allowed."
  explanation: "This joke applies functional programming concepts (specifically Haskell's purity and avoidance of side effects) to a social situation, creating humor through the incongruity of taking technical principles literally."
  rating: 8

- text: "JavaScript: 'I can run anywhere!' Java: 'I've been running everywhere since 1995.' Assembly: 'You're both just running on top of me.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory in reverse, with the oldest language asserting dominance, while also playing on the double meaning of 'running' (executing code vs. being present)."
  rating: 8

- text: "A Python developer and a C developer walk into a bar. The Python developer orders a beer. By the time the C developer finishes allocating memory for his order, the bar is closed."
  explanation: "This narrative joke exaggerates the speed difference and manual memory management requirements of C versus Python's simplicity, using absurdity to highlight language war stereotypes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Lisp developers don't have arguments. They have (arguments)."
  explanation: "A concise visual joke that plays on Lisp's parentheses-heavy syntax while using the double meaning of 'arguments' (disputes vs. function parameters), creating humor through format itself."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do TypeScript developers sleep well at night? Because their types are checked. Why do JavaScript developers sleep well? Because they don't know what's wrong yet."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts the security of static typing with the blissful ignorance of dynamic typing, using the relief theory to comment on the anxiety of runtime errors."
  rating: 9

- text: "A Scala developer, a Kotlin developer, and a Clojure developer walk into a bar. The bartender says, 'What is this, a JVM reunion?'"
  explanation: "This joke acknowledges the common ground between competing languages while poking fun at the proliferation of JVM-based languages, each claiming to be better than the others."
  rating: 7

- text: "C developers: 'Real programmers manage their own memory!' Garbage-collected language developers: 'Real programmers have better things to do.'"
  explanation: "This joke captures the fundamental philosophical divide between manual and automatic memory management, using the superiority theory from both perspectives."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Go developer break up with the Node.js developer? Too many callbacks in their relationship."
  explanation: "This joke applies the technical concept of callback hell to a romantic relationship, using the misdirection pattern to create humor from the unexpected application of programming concepts."
  rating: 8

- text: "Fortran: Still running the same code from 1957. JavaScript: Breaking your code with a new framework since this morning."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses temporal contrast and exaggeration to highlight the stability-chaos spectrum of programming languages, with humor arising from the extreme characterizations."
  rating: 9

- text: "A Swift developer says to an Objective-C developer: 'Your syntax is so verbose!' The Objective-C developer replies: '[self agree:YES withEnthusiasm:@\"moderate\" consideringHistoricalContext:YES]'"
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates its own punchline through example, using Objective-C's notoriously verbose syntax to prove the Swift developer's point while creating humor through self-awareness."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do Rust developers always win debates? Because they prove memory safety at compile time, including the safety of their arguments."
  explanation: "This meta-joke applies Rust's core feature (compile-time guarantees) to argumentation itself, using the absurdity technique to celebrate Rust's philosophy while poking fun at its advocates' confidence."
  rating: 7

- text: "COBOL developer: 'My code has been running for 40 years without changes.' Modern developer: 'I'm so sorry.'"
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly inverts expectationsâ€”what the COBOL developer presents as a point of pride becomes a source of sympathy, highlighting the tension between stability and innovation in language wars."
  rating: 10

- text: "A hiring manager asks, 'Do you have experience with Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C++, and Ruby?' The candidate replies, 'Yes, I've argued about all of them on Reddit.'"
  explanation: "This joke serves as a meta-commentary on language wars themselves, suggesting that the debates about languages have become more prominent than actual expertise, while using self-aware humor to acknowledge the absurdity of endless programming language arguments."
