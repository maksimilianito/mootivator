- text: "My code compiled on the first try. Now I'm more worried than when it had errors."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the programmer's paradoxical experience where success feels suspicious. The incongruity lies in being more concerned about apparent success than failure, because bugs that don't immediately show themselves are often the most dangerous ones lurking in production."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer's bug report get rejected? It was working as intended... on his machine."
  explanation: "This references the classic 'works on my machine' excuse developers use when bugs appear in production but not locally. The humor comes from the absurdity of this being the actual reason for rejection, highlighting the frustration of environment-specific bugs."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A play on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, this joke uses self-deprecating humor about the dangerous practice of testing in live environments. The superiority theory applies as we laugh at the obviously bad practice while recognizing we've all been tempted."

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
  explanation: "This joke perfectly captures the difference between testing and real-world usage through escalating absurdity. QA tests all the edge cases, but the actual bug comes from an untested normal scenario, highlighting the impossibility of anticipating every user action."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? So the bugs can't see them coming."
  explanation: "This takes the common phrase 'light attracts bugs' and applies double meaning - both insects and software errors. The misdirection suggests programmers are hunting bugs like predators, creating a humorous visual image."
  rating: 7

- text: "My software never has bugs. It just develops random undocumented features."
  explanation: "The classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' defense taken to its logical extreme. The humor comes from the reframing of obvious failures as intentional design choices, a coping mechanism familiar to all developers."
  rating: 6

- text: "How do you know if a bug is a feature? Check if it made it to the release notes."
  explanation: "This cynical observation plays on how bugs that survive long enough often get documented as 'quirks' rather than fixed. The joke highlights the pragmatic (or lazy) approach to bug management in real software development."
  rating: 7

- text: "I fixed a bug yesterday. Today I have three new ones. I think they're reproducing."
  explanation: "This joke uses biological metaphor to describe the frustrating reality of bug fixing - solving one problem often creates multiple new ones. The absurdity of bugs 'reproducing' like organisms adds to the humor while expressing genuine developer pain."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer go to therapy? He had too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'issues' refers both to psychological problems and bug tracking tickets. The setup suggests personal problems but the punchline works on both levels, making it effective wordplay."
  rating: 8

- text: "There are two types of programmers: those who write bugs, and liars."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the 'two types of people' format to make a universal truth funny. The superiority theory applies as we acknowledge our own fallibility while calling out those who claim perfection."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code is like my jokes - I think they're great until someone else tries to understand them."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating meta-humor that compares code quality to joke quality. The incongruity comes from the developer's confidence being inversely proportional to others' comprehension, a common experience in code reviews."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't bugs ever take vacations? They're always working overtime in production."
  explanation: "This personifies bugs as overachieving employees, creating humor through the unexpected comparison. It also reflects the reality that bugs seem most active when they cause the most damage - during peak usage times."
  rating: 6

- text: "I spent three hours debugging. The problem was a missing semicolon. I'm not crying, you're crying."
  explanation: "This captures the emotional rollercoaster of finding a trivial solution to what seemed like a complex problem. The defensive 'you're crying' adds emotional authenticity to the frustration every programmer has experienced."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature request? About six months and who's asking."
  explanation: "This cynical observation reveals how perspective and timing change bug classification. Something urgent becomes 'working as designed' when convenient, highlighting the political nature of bug management."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote perfect code once. Then the requirements changed."
  explanation: "A one-liner that captures the futility of perfection in software development. The joke lies in the impossibility of the first statement combined with the inevitability of the second, expressing the developer's eternal struggle."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the exception go to court? It wanted to be handled properly for once."
  explanation: "This personifies an exception as seeking justice, playing on 'exception handling' terminology. The humor comes from the implication that exceptions are usually mistreated or ignored, which is unfortunately often true."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks: 'Could you go to the store and get a gallon of milk? And if they have eggs, get a dozen.' The programmer returns with 12 gallons of milk. The spouse asks why. 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "This classic joke perfectly illustrates how programmers interpret instructions literally like code logic. The if-condition applies to the entire previous statement in the programmer's mind, creating absurd results. It's funny because it reveals how programming logic can override common sense."
  rating: 9

- text: "99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, patch it around, 127 little bugs in the code."
  explanation: "A parody of '99 Bottles of Beer' that captures the exponential nature of bug fixing. The number increasing instead of decreasing, and specifically to 127 (a significant binary number), adds technical depth to the frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't Node how to Express himself. Then he had a Breakdown and couldn't React. His therapist said he needed a Vue from a different Angular."
  explanation: "This joke is densely packed with JavaScript framework puns (Node, Express, React, Vue, Angular) while telling a coherent story about mental health. The multiple layers of wordplay reward technical knowledge while remaining narratively amusing."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a database operation in a social setting. The humor works on multiple levels - the literal database JOIN operation, the social act of joining tables at a bar, and the politeness of asking permission."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25. But when they tried to celebrate, everything crashed because they forgot to handle the exception of Feb 29."
  explanation: "This extends the classic octal/decimal joke (31 in base 8 equals 25 in base 10) with an additional layer about leap year bugs. The escalation from a simple pun to a more complex scenario about edge cases makes it progressively funnier for technical audiences."
