- text: "Code reviews: where 'looks good to me' means 'I scrolled past it.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common abbreviation 'LGTM' (Looks Good To Me) in code reviews, suggesting reviewers sometimes approve code without thorough examination. It uses a simple statement format to highlight the incongruity between what reviewers say and what they actually do."

- text: "Why do developers fear code reviews? Because someone might actually read their comments."
  explanation: "This uses the question-answer format to reveal the irony that developers often write TODO comments or sarcastic remarks in code, assuming no one will read them carefully. The punchline subverts the expectation that they'd fear criticism of the code itself."

- text: "My code reviewer found a bug in my logic. I found a typo in their feedback. We're even."
  explanation: "This joke employs the superiority theory through mutual deflection, showing how developers sometimes defensively respond to criticism by pointing out flaws in the reviewer's response rather than accepting feedback gracefully."

- text: "Code review status: 'Approved with 47 comments.' That's not approval, that's a rewrite request with extra steps."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurdity of technically approving code while simultaneously requesting numerous changes. The misdirection lies in the word 'approved' which usually means acceptance, but here means the opposite."

- text: "What's the difference between a code review and a therapy session? In therapy, you pay someone to tell you what's wrong with you."
  explanation: "This comparative joke uses the relief theory, suggesting code reviews are like free therapy sessions where colleagues point out your flaws. The humor comes from the unexpected comparison between professional code feedback and psychological counseling."

- text: "I don't always write perfect code, but when I do, my reviewer finds the one edge case I missed."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while expressing the frustration of having seemingly perfect code scrutinized. The incongruity lies in the contrast between confidence and the inevitable discovery of flaws."

- text: "Code review feedback: 'This is brilliant!' Translation: 'I have no idea what this does, so I'll assume you do.'"
  explanation: "This joke exposes the double meaning in code review praise, revealing that sometimes positive feedback masks confusion rather than genuine approval. It plays on the misdirection between surface-level comments and actual understanding."

- text: "My pull request has been open for three weeks. I'm not sure if it's under review or if everyone's just avoiding eye contact."
  explanation: "This uses absurdity and exaggeration to highlight the common problem of pull requests being ignored. The anthropomorphization of avoiding eye contact adds to the humor by comparing digital interaction to awkward social situations."

- text: "Why did the developer approve their own pull request? Because they believed in self-love and continuous integration."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'self-love' as both psychological wellness and the questionable practice of self-approving code. It adds 'continuous integration' as a technical justification for what's typically considered bad practice."

- text: "Code reviews are like dental checkups: necessary, uncomfortable, and you always leave feeling like you should have done more flossing."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares code reviews to dental visits, with 'flossing' representing regular code maintenance and best practices. The humor comes from the universally relatable experience of dental guilt applied to programming."

- text: "Reviewer's comment: 'Can you explain this function?' My inner monologue: 'If I could explain it, I would have written better code.'"
  explanation: "This reveals the paradox where unclear code often reflects unclear thinking. The joke uses the setup-punchline structure to expose the truth that developers sometimes don't fully understand their own complex solutions."

- text: "I wrote 500 lines of code. My reviewer left 501 comments. I'm pretty sure one of them was just 'Wow.'"
  explanation: "The absurdity here comes from having more comments than lines of code, suggesting either extremely thorough review or extremely problematic code. The single word 'Wow' adds comedic relief suggesting overwhelmed disbelief."

- text: "What do code reviewers and art critics have in common? They both know exactly how you should have done it after you've already done it."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses the superiority theory by poking fun at the hindsight bias of reviewers. It draws a parallel between two fields where criticism comes easily after the creative work is complete."

- text: "My code review process: Submit PR, make coffee, return to 23 notifications, question life choices, fix everything, repeat."
  explanation: "This story-format joke captures the emotional rollercoaster of code reviews through a relatable sequence. The escalation from mundane activity (coffee) to existential crisis (questioning life choices) creates comedic exaggeration."

- text: "Why do code reviews take so long? Because 'I'll look at it tomorrow' is the developer's version of 'let me check my calendar.'"
  explanation: "This joke exposes the procrastination culture in code reviews by comparing it to the social nicety of avoiding commitment. The parallel between professional and social avoidance behaviors creates the humor."

- text: "Code reviewer: 'This could be more elegant.' Me: 'So could your feedback, but here we are.'"
  explanation: "This dialogue joke uses a snappy comeback to highlight the tension between reviewers and developers. The meta-humor of criticizing the criticism itself creates a satisfying reversal of the typical power dynamic."

- text: "I once received code review feedback so detailed, it included suggestions for variable names in my test files. I didn't know whether to be grateful or file a restraining order."
  explanation: "This escalating joke starts with seemingly helpful feedback but pushes it to an absurd extreme, comparing over-zealous reviewing to stalking. The relief theory applies as it vents frustration through exaggeration."

- text: "What's a code reviewer's favorite dance move? The nitpick shuffle: two steps forward, three comments about formatting, one step back."
  explanation: "This creative metaphor transforms code review behavior into a dance, with 'nitpick shuffle' perfectly capturing the back-and-forth nature of reviews focused on minor details rather than substantive issues."

- text: "My code review came back with 'Please add more comments.' I added: '// Please approve this PR.' It did not go well."
  explanation: "This story uses literal interpretation humor, where the developer deliberately misunderstands the request for code comments by adding a meta-comment. The deadpan 'It did not go well' provides perfect understatement."

- text: "Code reviews are the only place where 'this is fine' and 'everything is on fire' can both be accurate descriptions of the same pull request."
  explanation: "This joke references the famous 'this is fine' meme while highlighting the subjective nature of code reviews. The paradox of two opposite assessments being simultaneously true creates cognitive dissonance that resolves in humor."

- text: "Why did the senior developer's code review consist of a single emoji? Because after 20 years, they've achieved enlightenment: sometimes ðŸ‘€ says more than a thousand words, and the developer already knows what needs fixing anyway."
  explanation: "This joke combines multiple layers: the wisdom of experience, the efficiency of minimal communication, and the truth that developers often know their code's flaws before review. The ðŸ‘€ emoji perfectly captures 'I see what you did there' in all its ambiguous glory, making this a meta-commentary on the entire code review process achieving maximum impact with minimum effort."
