- text: "I changed my password to 'incorrect' so whenever I forget it, the system tells me 'Your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of error messages. The humor comes from the incongruity between the intended meaning of the error message and the actual password value, creating a situation where the system appears to be helpfully revealing the password."

- text: "Why did the firewall go to therapy? It had too many trust issues."
  explanation: "This uses personification to compare a firewall's security function (blocking untrusted connections) to human psychological problems. The double meaning of 'trust issues' works both technically and emotionally."
  rating: 7

- text: "My encryption is so strong, even I can't read my own files anymore."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke highlights the common problem of losing encryption keys or passwords, turning a security feature into a personal inconvenience through exaggeration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't hackers ever get locked out? They always find the back door."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'back door' - both a physical entrance and a security vulnerability in software. The misdirection suggests physical access before revealing the technical meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break, and it recommended a firewall."
  explanation: "The humor comes from the misinterpretation of 'break' - the computer interprets a human need for rest as a security breach requiring protection, applying technical solutions to human problems."

- text: "Security expert's house: seven locks on the door, password is still 'password123'."
  explanation: "This joke uses ironic contrast between physical security measures and digital security negligence, highlighting the common gap between knowledge and practice even among experts."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the encryption algorithm break up with the hash function? It couldn't handle the one-way relationship."
  explanation: "This personifies cryptographic functions, using relationship terminology to describe the technical difference between reversible encryption and irreversible hashing, creating humor through romantic metaphor."
  rating: 9

- text: "My password is so secure, I write it on a sticky note so I don't forget where I encrypted it."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurd contradiction of using strong encryption while completely defeating it with the weakest possible physical security measure."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do security professionals make terrible comedians? They keep blocking the punchlines."
  explanation: "This uses the technical concept of blocking (filtering content) and applies it to joke delivery, suggesting overzealous security prevents humor from reaching its target."
  rating: 7

- text: "I implemented two-factor authentication on my fridge. Now I'm locked out and starving."
  explanation: "The joke applies excessive security measures to everyday objects, creating an absurd scenario where security becomes more problematic than the threat it prevents."
  rating: 8

- text: "A hacker walks into a bar. Or did he? The logs show nothing."
  explanation: "This creates suspense and then subverts it by suggesting the hacker covered their tracks by deleting logs, playing with the uncertainty that comes from missing security data."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the security admin refuse to go camping? Too many open ports in the tent."
  explanation: "This applies network security terminology (open ports as vulnerabilities) to a physical camping scenario, creating humor through the absurd application of technical thinking to outdoor recreation."
  rating: 7

- text: "My computer has Stockholm Syndrome. It keeps trusting the same malware that infected it."
  explanation: "This uses psychological terminology to describe the behavior of a compromised system that continues to allow malicious software, creating dark humor through personification."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a hacker's favorite season? Phishing season."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'phishing' (social engineering attacks) and 'fishing' (recreational activity), suggesting hackers have a seasonal preference for their attacks like hunters or fishermen."
  rating: 6

- text: "I encrypted my diary with military-grade security. The NSA now knows about my crush on Janet from accounting."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that strong encryption might attract more attention from intelligence agencies than it prevents, and the mundane content doesn't warrant the security level applied."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't cryptographers ever win at poker? They can't keep anything in plain text."
  explanation: "This applies the cryptographic concept of encryption (opposite of plain text) to the poker requirement of maintaining a 'poker face,' suggesting cryptographers habitually encrypt everything including their emotions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A SQL injection walks into a bar, drops all the tables, and says 'Sorry, just testing your security.'"
  explanation: "This personifies a common attack vector and creates a physical scenario from a database attack, with the punchline being the casual attitude hackers might have toward destructive security testing."
  rating: 9

- text: "My password manager got hacked. Now I have trust issues with the thing designed to solve my trust issues."
  explanation: "This creates recursive irony where the solution to security problems becomes the security problem itself, highlighting the philosophical challenge of securing security tools."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the security researcher bring a ladder to work? He heard the company had a high vulnerability."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'high' (severity rating in security) and physical height, creating a visual absurdity of someone trying to physically access a conceptual security problem."
  rating: 5

- text: "I practice security through obscurity. My code is so bad, nobody wants to hack it."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke subverts the criticized security practice of 'security through obscurity' by suggesting code quality itself becomes a deterrent, turning a weakness into an accidental defense."

- text: "A penetration tester, a firewall admin, and an encryption specialist walk into a bar. The bartender says, 'Is this some kind of security breach?' The pen tester replies, 'Only if you don't patch your beer taps.' The firewall admin adds, 'I would've blocked them at the door.' The encryption specialist just sits there silently. Nobody knows what he's thinking."
  explanation: "This elaborate joke brings together three security roles with responses that perfectly match their professional perspectives - the pen tester finds vulnerabilities everywhere, the firewall admin wants to block everything, and the encryption specialist remains mysterious and unreadable, just like encrypted data. The layered humor works on multiple levels, reflecting how security professionals see the world through their specialized lenses."
