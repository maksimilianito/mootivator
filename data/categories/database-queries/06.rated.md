```yaml
- text: "My first SQL query returned 0 rows. At least it was consistent."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the beginner experience where even getting no results feels like an accomplishment because the query actually ran without errors. The humor comes from the low bar of success and the relief theory of finding a silver lining in failure."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the database administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the higher-level queries."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'higher-level' having both a physical meaning (requiring a ladder) and a technical meaning (more complex queries). This uses incongruity between literal and figurative interpretations."
  rating: 4

- text: "I asked my database for a date. It gave me a timestamp instead."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'date' as both a romantic outing and a data type in SQL. The database's literal interpretation creates the humorous misdirection."
  rating: 7

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- 0 rows returned"
  explanation: "This self-deprecating SQL comment suggests that querying for users with any clue returns nothing, implying all users are clueless. The humor comes from the superiority theory turned inward, and the realistic frustration of dealing with user behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "My database relationships are more complicated than my personal ones, and they're better documented."
  explanation: "This compares database relationship complexity (foreign keys, joins) with personal relationships, using the unexpected twist that the technical relationships are actually better maintained. It reflects the developer's life category of humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? Because they always show their indexes."
  explanation: "A pun on 'showing your hand' in poker and database indexes that reveal data structure. The personification of databases combined with wordplay creates the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "I tried to write a query without a WHERE clause once. I'm still waiting for the results."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the consequence of an inefficient query that returns all rows, suggesting it's taking so long the person is still waiting. It plays on the common mistake of forgetting to filter data properly."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a database administrator's favorite dance? The LEFT JOIN shuffle."
  explanation: "This creates an absurd image of a dance move named after a SQL operation. The humor comes from applying technical terminology to a completely unrelated social activity."
  rating: 5

- text: "My query optimization strategy: keep adding indexes until something breaks or it works."
  explanation: "This honestly describes a trial-and-error approach to performance tuning, using relief theory to acknowledge the sometimes chaotic nature of database optimization. The humor is in the admission of an unscientific method."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the SQL query go to therapy? It had too many INNER conflicts."
  explanation: "A sophisticated pun on 'inner conflicts' (psychological issues) and INNER JOIN operations. The personification of a query having emotional problems creates layered humor for technical audiences."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my queries in production, but when I do, I forget the WHERE clause on my DELETE statement."
  explanation: "This uses the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format to describe every DBA's worst nightmare - deleting all rows instead of specific ones. The humor comes from the catastrophic consequence of a simple mistake."
  rating: 9

- text: "How do you comfort a database? You give it a warm BACKUP hug."
  explanation: "A play on 'backup' as both emotional support and database disaster recovery. The pun works on multiple levels and creates a wholesome image of caring for databases."
  rating: 6

- text: "My boss asked me to make the database faster. So I deleted all the data. Problem solved!"
  explanation: "This uses absurdist logic where the solution technically works (empty databases are fast) but completely defeats the purpose. The joke highlights the difference between solving the stated problem versus the actual need."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a query that returns exactly what you need on the first try? A lie."
  explanation: "This cynical one-liner reflects the reality that queries rarely work perfectly the first time. The unexpected answer subverts the setup for a typical riddle format."
  rating: 8

- text: "I named my cat SELECT because she ignores me unless I specify exactly what I want with perfect syntax."
  explanation: "This creates a humorous parallel between SQL's requirement for precise syntax and a cat's selective attention. The extended metaphor works because both require exact specification to get desired results."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SQL? Too many relationship issues, and every JOIN was complicated."
  explanation: "This uses relationship terminology that applies to both romantic relationships and database relationships. The double meaning of 'JOIN' and 'relationship' creates multiple layers of wordplay."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a query so complex that when I came back to it the next day, I had to EXPLAIN it to myself."
  explanation: "This uses EXPLAIN (the SQL command for query analysis) as both a technical term and a literal description of needing to understand one's own code. The self-deprecating humor acknowledges the common experience of not understanding your own past work."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's queries? About 15 unnecessary JOINs and a prayer."
  explanation: "This jokes about the learning curve in SQL optimization, where beginners often over-complicate queries. The addition of 'and a prayer' adds absurdist humor about hoping inefficient queries will work."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to UNION with my database, but we had irreconcilable differences in our column counts."
  explanation: "This plays on UNION operations requiring matching column structures, framed as a relationship incompatibility. The technical accuracy combined with relationship terminology creates sophisticated wordplay."
  rating: 7

- text: "My database has trust issues. Every time I ask for data, it demands credentials and won't let me in without proper authentication. We're working on our relationship."
  explanation: "This personifies database security as relationship problems, creating an extended metaphor where authentication becomes trust issues. The commitment to 'working on the relationship' adds an extra layer of absurdity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do database administrators make terrible comedians? Because their best jokes require a 30-minute EXPLAIN ANALYZE before anyone gets the punchline, and even then, someone will suggest a better execution plan."
  explanation: "This meta-joke about database humor itself uses technical terminology (EXPLAIN ANALYZE) while commenting on how technical jokes often need extensive explanation. The additional twist about optimizing the joke like a query creates recursive humor that works on multiple levels for technical audiences."
