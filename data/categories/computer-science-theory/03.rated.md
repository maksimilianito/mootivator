- text: "I tried to prove P=NP, but my proof had O(n!) complexity."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that attempting to solve the most famous complexity theory problem resulted in one of the worst possible time complexities (factorial time), highlighting the difficulty of the problem itself."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Turing machine go to therapy? It couldn't decide if it would halt."
  explanation: "This references the halting problem, one of computer science's fundamental undecidable problems, personifying the machine's computational uncertainty as psychological indecision."
  rating: 8

- text: "My algorithm is so efficient, it solves problems before they exist. Unfortunately, that's undecidable."
  explanation: "This combines the concept of algorithmic efficiency with the notion of undecidability, creating an absurd scenario where prediction itself becomes a theoretical impossibility."
  rating: 6

- text: "Recursion: see Recursion."
  explanation: "A classic self-referential joke that demonstrates recursion by having the definition point back to itself, mimicking how recursive functions call themselves."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't complexity theorists go to parties? Because they can't handle the social NP-completeness."
  explanation: "This applies the concept of NP-complete problems (notoriously difficult computational problems) to social situations, suggesting social interactions are computationally intractable."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a program that generates all true statements. It's still running."
  explanation: "This references Gödel's incompleteness theorem and the impossibility of creating a complete and consistent formal system, suggesting the program will never finish its impossible task."
  rating: 9

- text: "How many computer scientists does it take to change a lightbulb? That's hardware—not our problem."
  explanation: "This plays on the abstraction principle in computer science, where theoreticians focus on abstract concepts rather than physical implementation, creating humor through professional deflection."
  rating: 8

- text: "My thesis proves that proving things is hard. The proof is left as an exercise to the reader."
  explanation: "This meta-joke about computational complexity and proof theory uses the infamous mathematical phrase to avoid actually proving the very claim about difficulty of proofs."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the algorithm break up with Big-O notation? It wanted a more exact relationship."
  explanation: "This personifies the tension between asymptotic analysis (Big-O) which gives approximate bounds, and exact analysis, framing it as a relationship issue about commitment to precision."
  rating: 6

- text: "I'd tell you a joke about the halting problem, but I don't know if it will ever finish."
  explanation: "This self-referential joke embodies the halting problem itself—the joke's completion is undecidable, mirroring the theoretical impossibility of determining if arbitrary programs will terminate."
  rating: 10

- text: "A finite automaton walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'We don't serve your kind here.' The automaton replies, 'That's okay, I can only accept regular languages anyway.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the formal language hierarchy, where finite automata can only recognize regular languages, using the limitation as a comeback to rejection."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why are quantum algorithms so confident? Because they exist in a superposition of being right and wrong until measured."
  explanation: "This applies quantum mechanics principles to algorithmic correctness, suggesting quantum algorithms maintain both states simultaneously, parodying both quantum computing and programmer overconfidence."
  rating: 7

- text: "My graph traversal algorithm has commitment issues—it does breadth-first dating."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes BFS (breadth-first search) as a dating strategy, where exploring all options at one level before going deeper mirrors fear of commitment."
  rating: 5

- text: "I proved that my algorithm terminates, but the proof itself doesn't."
  explanation: "This paradoxical joke creates a meta-level contradiction where the proof about termination is itself non-terminating, highlighting the recursive nature of formal verification."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the computer scientist plant a binary tree in his garden? He wanted to see it branch out, but it only grew in logarithmic time."
  explanation: "This combines the botanical metaphor of trees with the computational reality that balanced binary trees have logarithmic height, creating disappointment about slow growth."
  rating: 6

- text: "I optimized my code from O(2^n) to O(n^2). My users still hate me, but now my thesis advisor loves me."
  explanation: "This highlights the gap between theoretical improvement (exponential to polynomial is huge) and practical user experience (quadratic is still slow), showing different stakeholder priorities."
  rating: 9

- text: "A logician's spouse says, 'Go to the store and buy milk. If they have eggs, get a dozen.' The logician returns with 12 gallons of milk."
  explanation: "This classic joke exploits ambiguous quantifier scope in natural language—'a dozen' could refer to milk if eggs exist, demonstrating the precision required in formal logic versus human communication."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why don't Turing machines make good friends? They're either stuck in infinite loops or they halt on you unexpectedly."
  explanation: "This personifies the only two possible behaviors of Turing machines (halting or not halting) as relationship problems, creating humor through the application of formal computation to friendship."
  rating: 8

- text: "My research proves that some problems are harder than NP-complete. The funding committee said that's their problem, not mine."
  explanation: "This plays on complexity hierarchy (problems beyond NP) while using wordplay on 'problem'—the committee deflects the computational difficulty claim by treating it as a personal issue."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked a complexity theorist if they could help me move apartments. They said, 'Sure, but only if you can reduce it to a problem I've already solved.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes the reduction-based approach in complexity theory, where problems are solved by transforming them into known problems, applying this academic strategy absurdly to real-world tasks."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the lambda calculus expression go to the gym? To get better β-reduction. Now it's in normal form and can't be reduced anymore—it's having an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke uses lambda calculus terminology (beta-reduction, normal form) to create a narrative about self-improvement leading to an identity crisis when no further 'improvement' is possible, mirroring human fears about reaching one's potential."
