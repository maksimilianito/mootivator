- text: "We removed the feature users complained about. Now they complain it's missing. We call this 'engagement.'"

- text: "Why do UX designers make terrible mind readers? Because when they finally guess what users want, users have already changed their minds."

  rating: 6

- text: "We conducted extensive user research, created detailed personas, mapped the entire journey, and tested with real users. Then the CEO's spouse tried it and now we're starting over."
  explanation: "This extended setup creates a comprehensive picture of proper UX methodology, only to have it all destroyed by the classic 'highest paid person's opinion' problem. The specificity of 'CEO's spouse' adds an extra layer of absurdity, making it the most sophisticated joke that combines multiple frustrations: politics overriding research, the invalidation of professional work, and the reality that decision-making power often trumps user data."
