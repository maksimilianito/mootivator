- text: "TCP tried to tell a joke, but UDP didn't wait to hear the punchline."
  explanation: "This plays on the fundamental difference between TCP (which ensures delivery and order) and UDP (which just sends data without confirmation). TCP would wait for acknowledgment, while UDP wouldn't care if you received the joke or not."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did HTTP go to therapy? It had too many unresolved requests."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'unresolved' - both as a psychological term and as a technical term for HTTP requests that haven't received responses, creating incongruity between therapy language and protocol behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "ICMP walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'We don't serve your type here.' ICMP replies, 'Destination unreachable.'"
  explanation: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) sends error messages like 'Destination unreachable.' The joke applies this technical response to a social rejection scenario, creating humor through unexpected context switching."
  rating: 8

- text: "SSH and Telnet went on a date. Only SSH kept its secrets."
  explanation: "SSH is encrypted while Telnet sends data in plain text. This personifies the protocols in a dating scenario where 'keeping secrets' has both romantic and security implications."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't network protocols ever win arguments? Because they always have to acknowledge the other side."
  explanation: "This references the ACK (acknowledgment) packets in protocols like TCP, playing on the double meaning of 'acknowledge' in both technical and conversational contexts."
  rating: 6

- text: "FTP is so old-fashioned, it still insists on a separate connection just to talk about its feelings."
  explanation: "FTP uses separate control and data connections, which is architecturally unusual. The joke personifies this as emotional unavailability or old-fashioned communication styles."
  rating: 8

- text: "A packet walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we only serve in segments.' The packet replies, 'That's fine, I'll take it in parts.'"
  explanation: "This plays on TCP segmentation, where data is broken into segments for transmission. The joke creates incongruity by applying this technical process to ordering a drink."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the DNS server break up with its partner? Too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses. 'Unresolved' works both as a relationship term and a technical term for failed DNS lookups, creating layered meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "SMTP walked into a party uninvited. When asked to leave, it said, 'I don't need authentication!'"
  explanation: "Basic SMTP traditionally had no authentication, allowing anyone to send emails. This security flaw is humorously portrayed as social rudeness."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why is TCP so reliable in relationships? It always waits for acknowledgment before moving on."
  explanation: "TCP's three-way handshake and ACK mechanism ensure reliable delivery. The joke applies this technical reliability to romantic relationships, where waiting for confirmation is considered thoughtful."
  rating: 7

- text: "A DHCP server walks into a bar. Bartender: 'What'll it be?' DHCP: 'Give me whatever's available, I'm not picky.'"
  explanation: "DHCP automatically assigns available IP addresses from a pool. The joke personifies this as someone who's easygoing about their choices, creating humor through the contrast between technical assignment and casual indifference."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did ARP get kicked out of the neighborhood? It kept asking everyone who they were."
  explanation: "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) broadcasts requests asking 'Who has this IP address?' to map IPs to MAC addresses. The joke portrays this as annoying social behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "BGP routers never gossip. They just share reachability information with all their neighbors."
  explanation: "BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routers exchange routing information with neighboring routers. The joke uses 'gossip' as a euphemism for this legitimate information sharing, creating meta-humor about network communication."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the NAT router become a therapist? It was great at translating between different address spaces."
  explanation: "NAT (Network Address Translation) translates between private and public IP addresses. The joke extends this to translating between different 'mental spaces' in therapy, creating sophisticated wordplay."
  rating: 8

- text: "HTTPS and HTTP went to a costume party. HTTP showed up naked. HTTPS said, 'Dude, where's your layer?'"
  explanation: "HTTPS adds a security layer (TLS/SSL) over HTTP. 'Where's your layer?' works as both a clothing question and a reference to the OSI model layers, creating technical wordplay."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't IPv6 addresses ever feel lonely? Because they have 128 bits of personal space."
  explanation: "IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses versus IPv4's 32-bit, providing an enormous address space. The joke plays on 'personal space' as both technical capacity and emotional distance."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SYN packet walks into a bar. Bartender sends back SYN-ACK. The packet never responds. Bartender mutters, 'Another half-open conversation.'"
  explanation: "This describes a SYN flood attack or incomplete TCP handshake, where the final ACK never arrives, leaving connections half-open. The joke brilliantly parallels this with someone who starts but never finishes a conversation."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the network engineer bring a ladder to work? To reach the upper layers of the OSI model."
  explanation: "The OSI model has seven layers stacked conceptually from physical to application. The joke creates absurdist humor by treating these abstract layers as physical heights requiring a ladder."
  rating: 6

- text: "QUIC told TCP, 'You're too slow with all your handshaking.' TCP replied, 'At least I'm not UDP, pretending reliability is optional.'"
  explanation: "This captures the evolution of protocols: QUIC reduces latency compared to TCP, TCP ensures reliability unlike UDP. The joke creates a three-way personality conflict reflecting real protocol trade-offs and the competitive nature of protocol development."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the multicast packet go to therapy? It had abandonment issuesâ€”half its recipients just dropped it without saying goodbye."
  explanation: "Multicast sends data to multiple recipients simultaneously, but not all may receive it due to network conditions. The joke personifies packet loss as emotional trauma, creating dark humor about unreliable delivery."
  rating: 8

- text: "A network protocol walks into a bar and orders 255 drinks. The bartender asks, 'Why so many?' The protocol replies, 'I'm just trying to avoid a subnet mask.'"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated wordplay on subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and the phrase 'mask your feelings.' The number 255 references common subnet boundaries, while 'avoid a mask' suggests both technical subnet configuration and emotional vulnerability, creating multiple layers of meaning."
