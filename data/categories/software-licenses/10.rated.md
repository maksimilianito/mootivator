- text: "I chose MIT License because I wanted my code to be free. Turns out, so did everyone else."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'free' - the developer wanted their code to be freely available (as in freedom), but didn't anticipate that it would also be free as in 'no cost' with no financial return. It's a gentle jab at the idealism of open source developers."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer read the entire EULA? He didn't."
  explanation: "This is a simple misdirection joke that sets up an expectation (someone actually reading an End User License Agreement) and immediately subverts it with reality - nobody reads those lengthy legal documents."
  rating: 5

- text: "My code is like GPL - once you touch it, everything you make becomes infected with my style."
  explanation: "This references the 'viral' nature of GPL (GNU General Public License) which requires derivative works to also be GPL-licensed, comparing it humorously to a coding style that spreads unavoidably."
  rating: 8

- text: "Proprietary software: Because nothing says 'I trust you' like a 47-page license agreement and three lawyers."
  explanation: "This joke uses ironic contrast between the concept of trust and the reality of extensive legal documentation, highlighting the absurdity of complex licensing in commercial software."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't open source developers go to confession? Their sins are already public in the commit history."
  explanation: "This plays on the transparency of open source development where all mistakes and bad decisions are permanently visible in version control, unlike proprietary software where errors can be hidden."
  rating: 9

- text: "I released my project under 'The Unlicense.' Now nobody uses it because they think it's illegal."
  explanation: "The Unlicense is a real license that dedicates code to the public domain, but the name ironically suggests the opposite, creating confusion - a perfect example of incongruity humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Apache License: For when you want to be generous but also slightly paranoid about patents."
  explanation: "This highlights the specific characteristic of Apache License 2.0, which includes explicit patent grants, suggesting a humorous middle ground between trust and legal caution."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's the difference between proprietary software and a black box? The black box eventually gets opened after a crash."
  explanation: "This dark humor compares closed-source software to airplane black boxes, suggesting that proprietary code is even more secretive since it never gets examined even when things go wrong."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wanted to fork a GPL project, but my lawyer forked first - right out of the meeting."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'fork' (creating a code branch vs. leaving quickly) and plays on the complexity and fear surrounding GPL compliance in corporate environments."
  rating: 8

- text: "Creative Commons licenses: Because sometimes your code is so artistic, copyright law gets confused."
  explanation: "This jokes about developers using Creative Commons (typically for creative works) instead of software licenses, highlighting the blurred lines between code as functional tool and creative expression."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the startup avoid GPL? They wanted to pivot, not be pivoted by their license."
  explanation: "This references startup culture's obsession with 'pivoting' (changing business direction) while noting that GPL's requirements could force business model changes, reversing who controls whom."
  rating: 7

- text: "BSD License: MIT License's older sibling who still mentions the family name everywhere."
  explanation: "This personifies the BSD licenses, which require attribution and mention of the license text, comparing it to a family-proud relative, while MIT is more relaxed and modern."
  rating: 7

- text: "My manager asked if our dependency was 'enterprise-ready.' I said, 'It has a LICENSE file.' He seemed satisfied."
  explanation: "This satirizes how simply having any license file is sometimes treated as sufficient due diligence in enterprise environments, regardless of actual license compatibility or code quality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Open source: Where 'free as in freedom' means you're free to fix my bugs at 2 AM."
  explanation: "This plays on the famous 'free as in freedom, not free as in beer' distinction, adding a cynical twist that the 'freedom' often means freedom to do unpaid labor maintaining software."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do developers love dual licensing? Because commitment issues aren't just for relationships."
  explanation: "Dual licensing (offering software under multiple licenses) is compared to romantic commitment issues, suggesting developers want to keep their options open rather than choosing one licensing philosophy."
  rating: 7

- text: "I chose WTFPL for my project. My lawyer chose a new client."
  explanation: "WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License) is a real, profane license. The joke suggests that even mentioning it professionally causes lawyers to abandon ship immediately."
  rating: 8

- text: "Proprietary licenses are just open source licenses with trust issues and a legal team."
  explanation: "This reframes proprietary software as fundamentally insecure open source, suggesting that restrictive licensing stems from psychological issues rather than legitimate business needs, using personification for humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer choose AGPL? He wanted to ensure that even cloud providers would fear his code."
  explanation: "AGPL (Affero GPL) closes the 'SaaS loophole' by requiring source release even for software accessed over networks, making it particularly restrictive for cloud services - hence the 'fear.'"
  rating: 8

- text: "I read the Oracle license agreement. Three hours later, I woke up in a different tax bracket owing them money."
  explanation: "This exaggerates Oracle's reputation for aggressive licensing enforcement and complex pricing, suggesting that merely reading their license creates financial obligations and causes unconsciousness from confusion."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a proprietary EULA and a horror novel? The horror novel is required to have a plot."
  explanation: "This compares End User License Agreements to horror novels, suggesting EULAs are even more terrifying but lack the courtesy of narrative structure, just pure legal dread without story."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the open source purist refuse to get married? He couldn't find a relationship license that was GPL-compatible with his freedom."
  explanation: "This takes open source philosophy to an absurd extreme, applying software licensing concepts to personal relationships, suggesting that commitment itself is a proprietary restriction on personal freedom - the ultimate meta-joke about licensing ideology."
