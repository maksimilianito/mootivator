- text: "My CS professor said recursion would eventually click. I'm still waiting for the base case."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the concept of recursion in computer science, where a function calls itself until reaching a base case. The student is stuck in an infinite loop of not understanding, ironically demonstrating the problem with recursion when there's no proper base case - it never terminates."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to lecture? The professor kept talking about higher-level languages."
  explanation: "This uses a literal interpretation of 'higher-level' programming languages (like Python or Java vs assembly language). The incongruity comes from treating an abstract technical concept as a physical height problem."
  rating: 5

- text: "I learned data structures in college. Now I organize my life in linked lists - always pointing to the next thing I need to do."
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of linked lists (where each element points to the next) to everyday life organization, creating humor through the over-application of CS concepts to mundane situations."
  rating: 7

- text: "Computer Science: where 'Hello World' takes one day to learn and four years to debug in production."
  explanation: "This contrasts the simplicity of the first program every CS student writes with the complexity of real-world software development, highlighting the gap between academic learning and professional practice."
  rating: 9

- text: "My CS degree taught me two things: how to Google efficiently and why I should have minored in coffee consumption."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that acknowledges the reality of modern programming - much of it involves searching for solutions online - while also referencing the stereotype of programmers relying heavily on caffeine."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't CS students ever finish their group projects on time? Because they spend the first 90% of the time arguing about which IDE to use."
  explanation: "This satirizes the tendency of programmers to get caught up in tooling debates (Integrated Development Environment preferences) rather than focusing on the actual work, a common frustration in academic group projects."
  rating: 8

- text: "In CS class, they taught us about the halting problem. Ironically, most students' understanding of it never halts either."
  explanation: "Meta-humor referencing the halting problem (a famous unsolvable problem in computer science about determining if a program will ever stop running) by suggesting students' confusion about it is similarly infinite."
  rating: 9

- text: "I got a B+ in Algorithms. The professor said my solutions worked but lacked elegance. Apparently, brute force isn't always the answer, just usually."
  explanation: "This plays on the tension between solutions that work (brute force approaches) versus optimal solutions (elegant algorithms), a common theme in CS education where correctness and efficiency are both valued."
  rating: 7

- text: "College CS: where you learn 15 sorting algorithms you'll never use and nothing about deploying to production."
  explanation: "This critiques the gap between academic CS curricula (focused on theoretical foundations like sorting algorithms) and practical industry needs (like deployment and DevOps), a common complaint among graduates."
  rating: 8

- text: "My professor said understanding Big O notation was critical. He was right - I'm now critically overthinking whether to use a for-loop."
  explanation: "This joke highlights how learning about algorithmic complexity (Big O notation) can lead to analysis paralysis, where students overthink simple programming decisions that don't actually matter for performance."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CS student fail the Turing Test? He kept trying to compile his answers before submitting them."
  explanation: "This combines two concepts: the Turing Test (determining if something is human or machine) with the programming habit of compiling code. The humor comes from the student behaving too much like a computer, ironically failing a test about being human."
  rating: 6

- text: "In my Operating Systems class, we learned about deadlock. Then we experienced it firsthand when everyone needed the same textbook from the library."
  explanation: "This creates a parallel between the technical concept of deadlock (where processes wait indefinitely for resources) and a real-world situation in academic life, making the abstract concept concrete and relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "CS education is the only field where 'it works on my machine' is considered a valid learning outcome."
  explanation: "This satirizes the common excuse programmers make when their code fails elsewhere but works locally, suggesting that CS programs sometimes accept this as sufficient, when it really indicates incomplete understanding of deployment and environment management."
  rating: 9

- text: "My Database course taught me about ACID properties. My GPA taught me about the acid reflux that comes from all-night coding sessions."
  explanation: "Double meaning joke playing on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - database transaction properties) and the physical acid reflux from stress and poor eating habits during intensive study periods."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do CS professors love recursive examples? Because after explaining it once, they can just refer back to themselves explaining it."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about recursion where the joke structure itself mimics the concept - the professor's explanation is recursive, just like the examples they're teaching, creating a self-referential loop."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my CS advisor what electives to take. He said 'it depends.' I should have known - that's the answer to every question in computer science."
  explanation: "This highlights how 'it depends' is the stereotypical answer to most technical questions in CS, as solutions are highly context-dependent, making it humorously useless as advice while being technically accurate."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our CS curriculum had a course called 'Theory of Computation.' Ironically, the theory was that none of us would actually compute anything during lectures."
  explanation: "This plays on the abstract, mathematical nature of theoretical CS courses where students spend time on proofs and theory rather than practical programming, creating irony between the course name and its content."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS department install a revolving door? So students could experience continuous integration in real life before learning it in DevOps class."
  explanation: "This creates an absurd parallel between a physical revolving door (continuous motion) and the software practice of continuous integration (continuously merging code changes), suggesting the university is teaching through architectural metaphors."
  rating: 5

- text: "My Machine Learning professor started every class with 'this will make sense eventually.' Three years later, I'm still training my understanding with insufficient data."
  explanation: "This uses ML terminology metaphorically - the student's brain is like a model that's still training with insufficient data to reach convergence (understanding). It captures the notorious difficulty of ML courses while using the subject's own concepts to describe the struggle."
  rating: 9

- text: "CS degree requirements: 120 credits, 4 years, and the ability to explain to your parents that no, you can't fix their printer, that's a different kind of computer science."
  explanation: "This addresses the common frustration of CS students being asked to fix hardware issues by family members who don't understand that computer science is about algorithms and software, not IT support, while humorously suggesting this should be part of the official curriculum."
  rating: 8

- text: "In Compiler Design, we learned that code goes through lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and optimization. My CV goes through the same process, except HR stops at lexical analysis when they see 'Python' and think I work with snakes."
  explanation: "This creates a sophisticated parallel between compiler phases and job application screening, with an absurdist twist at the end. It works on multiple levels: comparing code processing to resume screening, while ending with a literal interpretation of 'Python' that satirizes HR's sometimes superficial understanding of technical skills."
