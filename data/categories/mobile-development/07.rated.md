- text: "Mobile developers don't have bugs, they have 'device-specific features'."
  explanation: "This plays on the classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' defense, but adds the mobile development twist where apps behave differently across thousands of device configurations, making it easy to blame the hardware rather than the code."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the mobile app go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'dependencies' - both the technical term for external libraries that mobile apps rely on, and the psychological concept of unhealthy reliance on others. The anthropomorphization of the app creates the humorous incongruity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Android and iOS developers walk into a bar. They immediately start arguing about which platform is superior and never actually order drinks."
  explanation: "This reflects the real-world rivalry between the two major mobile platforms, using the classic 'walks into a bar' joke structure but subverting expectations by having them argue instead of delivering a traditional punchline."
  rating: 6

- text: "My mobile app supports all devices! (Tested on my phone only.)"
  explanation: "This highlights the common gap between claimed compatibility and actual testing practices in mobile development, where developers often only test on their own device despite the fragmentation of the mobile ecosystem."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do mobile developers always carry power banks? Because their apps drain batteries faster than they can say 'optimization'."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke addresses one of mobile development's biggest challenges - battery efficiency. The irony is that developers are victims of their own poorly optimized code."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally achieved 5-star ratings on my app! All three of my mom's accounts came through."
  explanation: "This plays on the desperation for good reviews in app stores and the common practice of asking friends and family for positive ratings, taken to a humorous extreme."
  rating: 8

- text: "Mobile development: where 'works on my machine' becomes 'works on my specific phone with this exact OS version'."
  explanation: "This adapts the classic programming excuse to the mobile context, where device fragmentation makes the problem exponentially worse than traditional software development."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the iOS developer refuse to go camping? No Xcode in the wilderness."
  explanation: "This references Xcode, Apple's development environment that only runs on macOS, highlighting how iOS developers are tethered to their Apple ecosystem even for simple tasks."
  rating: 6

- text: "The app store rejected my submission. Apparently 'minimalist design' doesn't mean 'I forgot to add features'."
  explanation: "This plays on the tension between genuinely minimalist design philosophy and incomplete development, using the app store review process as the reality check."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many mobile developers does it take to change a light bulb? None - they'll just add a dark mode instead."
  explanation: "This references the popular dark mode feature in modern apps, suggesting developers would rather add a feature than solve the actual problem, which is a common pattern in software development."
  rating: 9

- text: "My app crashed. The user's phone crashed. The user crashed. Turns out I forgot to handle the null case."
  explanation: "This escalates absurdly from technical crash to physical crash, all stemming from the classic programming error of not handling null values - a fundamental mistake with increasingly ridiculous consequences."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do mobile apps ask for so many permissions? They're trying to collect enough data to understand why users uninstall them."
  explanation: "This creates a humorous paradox where invasive permission requests (which often cause uninstalls) are justified as trying to understand user behavior, highlighting the self-defeating nature of aggressive data collection."
  rating: 9

- text: "I spent three weeks optimizing my app to load in 0.5 seconds instead of 0.7 seconds. Users still complain it's slow while their 47 other apps run in the background."
  explanation: "This highlights the frustration of optimization efforts being undermined by factors outside the developer's control, particularly users' own habits of running too many apps simultaneously."
  rating: 8

- text: "Android developer's prayer: 'Please let this work on Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, and that one weird phone from 2015 that somehow still has users'."
  explanation: "This emphasizes Android's notorious fragmentation problem, where developers must support countless manufacturers with custom Android versions, including ancient devices that refuse to die."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the mobile developer break up with their partner? They said 'I need more space' and the developer replied 'I can compress that'."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'space' (personal space vs. storage space) and shows how developers' technical mindset inappropriately applies to relationships, creating an incongruous and humorous situation."
  rating: 7

- text: "My app's loading spinner has been spinning so long, users think it's a feature. I'm rebranding it as 'meditation mode'."
  explanation: "This turns a performance bug into a supposed feature, taking the 'it's not a bug' excuse to an absurd extreme by pretending extended loading times are intentional wellness features."
  rating: 8

- text: "iOS: 'Your app must support the latest iPhone.' Android: 'Your app must support phones from the Jurassic period.' Flutter: 'Why not both simultaneously while crying?'"
  explanation: "This compares the platform requirements using personification, with Flutter (a cross-platform framework) being the exhausted middle ground trying to satisfy both ecosystems' contradictory demands."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the mobile app go viral? Because the developer forgot to sanitize user inputs and it literally spread malware."
  explanation: "This uses dark humor with the double meaning of 'viral' (popular vs. infected with a virus), turning a positive marketing term into a security nightmare caused by basic coding mistakes."
  rating: 8

- text: "My mobile app has achieved quantum state: it simultaneously works perfectly and is completely broken until the user observes it by leaving a one-star review."
  explanation: "This applies quantum mechanics concepts (Schr√∂dinger's cat) to the mobile development experience, where apps seem fine in testing but mysteriously fail in production, only discovered through negative reviews."
  rating: 10

- text: "Mobile developer's lifecycle: Excitement at project start, determination during development, desperation at testing, depression at app store review, and finally acceptance when reading user reviews like 'Doesn't work on my Samsung Smart Fridge - 1 star'."
  explanation: "This traces the emotional journey of mobile development with escalating absurdity, culminating in the ridiculous but somehow realistic scenario of users expecting apps to work on inappropriate devices."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why don't mobile developers trust the cloud? Because they've seen what happens when you assume there's always an internet connection. Spoiler: Users are in elevators, basements, tunnels, and apparently, the Bermuda Triangle."
  explanation: "This highlights the challenge of offline functionality in mobile apps, listing increasingly absurd locations where users expect apps to work, emphasizing the gap between ideal network conditions and reality."
