- text: "Why did the website go to therapy? It had too many broken links."
  explanation: "This joke employs the double meaning pattern, where 'broken links' refers both to non-functional hyperlinks and to damaged relationships or connections in psychological terms. The incongruity comes from treating a technical problem as an emotional issue."

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer having a really good day."
  explanation: "This aphorism plays with the mystique of 'cloud computing' by reducing it to its literal reality - remote servers. The humor comes from the anthropomorphization ('having a good day') combined with the deflation of technical jargon."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my ISP I wanted faster internet. They said, 'Have you tried turning your expectations off and on again?'"
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection by setting up the expectation of the classic IT solution ('turn it off and on again') but applies it to abstract concepts (expectations) rather than hardware, highlighting customer service frustrations."

- text: "What's a network engineer's favorite dance? The TCP handshake."
  explanation: "This joke relies on technical knowledge of the TCP three-way handshake protocol, anthropomorphizing it as a dance move. The humor comes from the unexpected connection between formal networking protocols and casual social activities."

- text: "My Wi-Fi password is 'incorrect' so when I forget it, my computer tells me 'your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates the misdirection pattern by creating a self-referential loop where the error message becomes literally true. It plays with the frustration of password management through clever wordplay."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't network packets ever get lonely? They always travel in frames."
  explanation: "This joke uses technical terminology with double meaning - 'frames' in networking refers to data link layer protocol units, but also suggests social groups or 'frames' of reference, creating a pun about companionship."
  rating: 6

- text: "The internet is like ancient Egypt: people writing on walls and worshipping cats."
  explanation: "This joke uses analogy and historical comparison to highlight the absurdity of modern online behavior, particularly social media culture. The incongruity between ancient civilization and modern technology creates the humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "How does a network administrator stay cool? They open Windows."
  explanation: "This joke employs wordplay between the physical act of opening windows for ventilation and the Windows operating system. The setup-punchline structure creates expectation for a networking solution but delivers a simple pun."

- text: "I asked my smart home if it loved me. It said, '404: Emotion Not Found.'"
  explanation: "This joke personifies IoT devices while using the familiar HTTP error code format to deliver an existential punchline about the limitations of artificial systems in understanding human emotions."

- text: "Why did the web developer walk out of the restaurant? Because they saw the table layout."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'table layout' - both a physical restaurant arrangement and the outdated HTML practice of using tables for web page layouts, which modern developers avoid."
  rating: 7

- text: "Bandwidth is like money: you never have enough, and someone's always using yours without asking."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses analogy to connect a technical resource (bandwidth) with a universal human experience (financial struggles), creating humor through the shared frustration of resource scarcity and unauthorized use."
  rating: 8

- text: "My internet is so slow, I tried to download a picture of a snail and it arrived before the image did."
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdist exaggeration to mock slow internet speeds. The logical impossibility (the physical object arriving before its digital representation) creates humor through hyperbole."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a network that's always gossiping? A chat-ternet protocol."
  explanation: "This joke creates a portmanteau combining 'chatter' and 'internet' while maintaining the structure of 'internet protocol,' anthropomorphizing network communication as social gossip."
  rating: 5

- text: "I'm not saying my connection is bad, but my video calls have been mistaken for abstract art exhibitions."
  explanation: "This joke uses understatement and metaphor to describe poor video quality, elevating pixelated, frozen video feeds to the status of intentional artistic expression, creating humor through reframing."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the firewall break up with the antivirus? Too many trust issues and constant blocking behavior."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes security software as having relationship problems, where technical functions (blocking threats, scanning for viruses) become toxic relationship behaviors, using the superiority theory through relatable human experiences."
  rating: 7

- text: "The three states of network connectivity: connected, disconnected, and 'why is everything so slow?'"
  explanation: "This aphorism subverts the binary expectation of connection status by adding a third, experiential state that every internet user recognizes, creating humor through shared frustration and truth-telling."
  rating: 9

- text: "How many network engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just keep pinging it until it responds."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the classic 'lightbulb' joke format by applying networking troubleshooting methodology (ping commands) to a physical problem, highlighting the tendency to apply technical solutions to non-technical issues."
  rating: 8

- text: "My router and I have a lot in common: we both need to be reset every time something goes wrong, and nobody really understands how we work."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke creates identification between human and machine, using the relief theory to acknowledge both technical frustration and personal vulnerability through parallel comparison."
  rating: 8

- text: "The internet never forgets, but somehow it always forgets my password."
  explanation: "This joke uses paradox and irony to highlight the contradiction between the internet's permanent record of everything and the personal frustration of password management, creating humor through the juxtaposition of collective memory and individual forgetfulness."
  rating: 9

- text: "My ISP called to ask if I was satisfied with my internet speed. I tried to answer, but the call kept buffering."
  explanation: "This joke uses recursive irony where the very problem being discussed (slow internet) prevents the discussion itself, creating a self-demonstrating situation that perfectly encapsulates the frustration of poor connectivity through meta-humor."
