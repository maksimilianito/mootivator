- text: "My SQL query returned 0 rows. Turns out I was looking for data in the production database."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common developer experience of working with empty test databases while forgetting that actual data only exists in production. The incongruity lies in the expectation that a query should return results, with the punchline revealing the mundane reason it didn't."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the database administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the higher-level queries."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'higher-level' as both a physical location and a programming concept referring to abstraction levels in query complexity."
  rating: 4

- text: "I tried to write an efficient query once. It took longer than just scanning the whole table."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony to highlight the paradox where optimization efforts sometimes take more time than the inefficient approach, a common frustration in database work."
  rating: 6

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- Returns empty set"
  explanation: "This is a self-deprecating SQL joke presented as actual code with a comment. It suggests querying for users with any clue returns nothing, implying all users (including the writer) are clueless."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a database administrator's favorite exercise? Table joins."
  explanation: "A straightforward pun connecting the physical exercise concept with the SQL JOIN operation that combines tables, using 'table' as the bridge word."
  rating: 5

- text: "My queries are like my relationships: complicated, inefficient, and usually end with unexpected results."
  explanation: "This joke uses analogy humor, comparing SQL queries to romantic relationships, with the shared characteristics building to a relatable punchline about disappointment in both domains."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my queries, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A reference to the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, highlighting the dangerous but unfortunately common practice of testing directly in production environments."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the LEFT JOIN go to therapy? It had abandonment issues with NULL values."
  explanation: "This personifies the LEFT JOIN operation, which returns NULL for unmatched rows, creating humor through the psychological framing of a technical behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "A DBA walks into a bar. He approaches two tables and asks, 'May I join you?'"
  explanation: "A classic setup-punchline joke using the double meaning of 'join' as both a social action and a SQL operation, with 'tables' working as both furniture and database objects."
  rating: 6

- text: "My boss asked me to optimize our queries. So I changed the font to make them look faster."
  explanation: "This uses absurdist humor and the superiority theory, presenting an obviously useless solution that mocks the disconnect between management requests and technical reality."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a query that returns exactly what you expected? A myth."
  explanation: "A short, cynical observation about the reality of database work where queries rarely work correctly on the first attempt, using exaggeration for effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours optimizing a query from 2 seconds to 0.5 seconds. The table had 10 rows."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the absurdity of over-optimization, where significant effort is wasted on negligible improvements for trivial datasets, a common developer trap."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't SQL queries ever win at poker? They always show their JOINS."
  explanation: "A pun playing on 'show their hand' in poker versus SQL's explicit JOIN syntax, suggesting SQL queries are too transparent to bluff."
  rating: 5

- text: "Hofstadter's Query Law: Every SQL query takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Query Law."
  explanation: "A meta-joke adapting Hofstadter's Law about recursion to database queries, capturing the recursive nature of underestimating query complexity and execution time."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote a query so nested, it needed its own therapist to work through its inner SELECT statements."
  explanation: "This personifies complex nested queries as having psychological depth, using the double meaning of 'inner' (both SQL subqueries and emotional introspection) for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "A junior developer's first query: SELECT * FROM everything. A senior developer's last query: SELECT * FROM everything."
  explanation: "This circular joke suggests that despite experience, developers return to the simplest (and worst) practice, implying either laziness or wisdom in simplicity, leaving the interpretation ambiguous."
  rating: 10

- text: "My database has trust issues. Every time I try to JOIN, it asks for my credentials."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes database security as relationship anxiety, with 'credentials' working as both authentication tokens and relationship qualifications, creating a layered pun."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a database and a teenager? A database actually responds to queries."
  explanation: "A comparison joke that sets up an expectation about technical differences but delivers a punchline about communication, making it relatable to both parents and developers."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my database a joke about INNER JOIN. It didn't get it because there was no matching sense of humor."
  explanation: "A self-referential meta-joke that uses the mechanics of INNER JOIN (which only returns matches) to explain why the joke itself wouldn't work, creating recursive humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the query go to the gym? To work on its execution plan. Now it's ripped but still takes forever to return results."
  explanation: "This joke builds on the setup of optimization expectations but subverts them by suggesting that despite improvement efforts (getting 'ripped'), the fundamental problem remains unsolved, reflecting real optimization frustrations."
  rating: 7

- text: "A developer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Before you enter, you must answer one question: What is the optimal way to structure this query?' The developer replied, 'Can I see the execution plan first?' St. Peter sighed, 'That's what the last thousand developers said. This is why the queue is so long.'"
  explanation: "This extended narrative joke works on multiple levels: it captures the developer's instinct to analyze before answering, suggests that over-analysis leads to paralysis (the long queue), and creates a humorous afterlife scenario where even heaven has performance issues. The joke structure builds tension through the setup and delivers multiple layers of meaning in the punchline."
