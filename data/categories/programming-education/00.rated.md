- text: "My first Python program was a snake that ate syntax errors instead of apples."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the Python logo (a snake) and the common beginner experience of encountering many syntax errors. It's a simple, relatable observation that uses the programming language's mascot as a visual metaphor."

- text: "I learned HTML in a day. Then I spent three years learning why my divs won't center."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity between the perceived simplicity of learning HTML basics versus the notorious difficulty of CSS layout problems, particularly the infamous div centering challenge that frustrates even experienced developers."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programming students love arrays? They're always at index zero of their learning journey!"
  explanation: "This plays on the programming concept of zero-based indexing (arrays start at 0) combined with the idea of being at the beginning of one's education. It's a technical pun that works on multiple levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "My professor said 'There are no stupid questions.' Then I asked why we can't just divide by zero."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through the student challenging a fundamental mathematical rule that causes errors in programming, showing both innocent curiosity and the kind of question that makes instructors reconsider their open-door policy."
  rating: 7

- text: "Teaching someone to code is easy. Teaching them to debug is like teaching a cat to swim upstream."
  explanation: "This uses absurdist imagery to highlight the difficulty gap between writing code and finding errors in it. The impossible scenario (cats swimming upstream) mirrors the seemingly impossible task of teaching effective debugging."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my coding bootcamp I had 'Hello World' on my resume. They hired me as senior developer."
  explanation: "This satirizes the sometimes questionable hiring practices in tech and the inflated titles given even to beginners, using the most basic program possible as the qualification for a senior position."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the student's first loop run forever? Because nobody taught them the importance of false!"
  explanation: "This plays on the common beginner mistake of creating infinite loops by not understanding loop exit conditions. The wordplay on 'false' (boolean value) and 'importance' creates a double meaning."
  rating: 5

- text: "My computer science degree taught me two things: how to code, and how to Google how to code."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke acknowledges the reality that modern programming education is as much about learning to find information as it is about memorizing syntax, reflecting the actual workflow of professional developers."
  rating: 9

- text: "Student: 'Is this code efficient?' Professor: 'It works, doesn't it?' Student: 'Yes.' Professor: 'Then it's efficient enough for homework.'"
  explanation: "This dialogue format highlights the different standards between academic and production code, where 'working' is often sufficient for learning purposes, even if the solution isn't optimized."
  rating: 7

- text: "I learned recursion by learning recursion by learning recursion by understanding recursion."
  explanation: "This joke IS recursion - it demonstrates the concept through its own structure, creating meta-humor that only makes sense once you understand what recursion actually means."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't programming students trust stairs? They prefer step-by-step tutorials with proper iteration!"
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'step' (physical stairs and tutorial steps) combined with the programming concept of iteration, creating a layered pun about learning methodology."
  rating: 5

- text: "My first sorting algorithm was organizing my life priorities. Both had O(nÂ²) complexity and neither worked."
  explanation: "This applies Big O notation (algorithm efficiency) to personal life, creating humor through the parallel between inefficient code and inefficient life management, while using proper technical terminology."
  rating: 8

- text: "Professor: 'What's the output?' Student: 'An error.' Professor: 'What kind?' Student: 'The red kind.'"
  explanation: "This captures the beginner's perspective where all errors look the same (just red text), before they learn to distinguish between syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my mentor how long it takes to master programming. He said 'Ten years, or one Stack Overflow account.'"
  explanation: "This joke acknowledges the reality of modern programming education where access to community knowledge (Stack Overflow) has dramatically changed the learning curve, compressing years of learning into searchable solutions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the student fail the coding interview? They tried to implement bubble sort on their anxiety levels - it just kept bubbling up!"
  explanation: "This combines the technical concept of bubble sort (a basic algorithm) with the emotional reality of interview stress, using the 'bubbling' metaphor to connect both concepts humorously."
  rating: 6

- text: "My coding bootcamp was twelve weeks. My imposter syndrome has been twelve years and counting."
  explanation: "This addresses the psychological reality of programming education, where technical skills develop quickly but confidence lags behind, using the time contrast for comedic effect while touching on a genuine industry issue."
  rating: 9

- text: "Student: 'Why is my code not working?' TA: 'You're missing a semicolon.' Student: 'Where?' TA: 'Everywhere.'"
  explanation: "This escalates from a simple syntax error to an absurd extreme, capturing the beginner experience where one type of mistake becomes systemic, and the TA's deadpan response amplifies the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "I learned object-oriented programming by treating my problems like objects - I inherited them, encapsulated them, and then polymorphed them into different problems."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses three core OOP concepts (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism) and applies them metaphorically to problem-solving in life, showing understanding while creating humor through misapplication."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do programming professors love teaching pointers? Because every lecture is an opportunity to watch students' faces dereference into confusion!"
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'dereference' (accessing the value a pointer points to) as a metaphor for the visible confusion on students' faces, as pointers are notoriously difficult to grasp initially."
  rating: 8

- text: "My final project was due at midnight. I started at 11:30 PM. Not because I procrastinated - I just wanted to practice working under realistic industry conditions."
  explanation: "This joke takes the common student behavior of last-minute work and reframes it as intentional professional training, satirizing both student habits and actual industry deadline pressures with perfect comic timing."
  rating: 10

- text: "They say those who can't do, teach. In programming, those who can't do either become Stack Overflow moderators and mark everything as duplicate."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke subverts the traditional saying, adds a programming-specific twist about Stack Overflow culture, and satirizes the sometimes frustrating experience of seeking help online, all while acknowledging the valuable (if strict) role moderators play in maintaining quality."
