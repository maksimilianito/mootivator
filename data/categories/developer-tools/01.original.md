```yaml
- text: My debugger has a trust issues setting—it's always on.
  explanation: This joke plays on the concept of debuggers being tools that question and verify everything in code, personifying this behavior as "trust issues" which is a human psychological trait. The humor comes from applying human emotional problems to developer tools.

- text: Why did the profiler go to therapy? It had too many performance issues.
  explanation: This uses a classic setup-punchline structure with double meaning. "Performance issues" works both as a technical term (what profilers measure) and a personal problem, creating incongruity by treating the profiler as a person with psychological problems.

- text: My IDE's autocomplete is so aggressive, it finished my resignation letter before I could.
  explanation: This joke uses exaggeration and misdirection. We expect autocomplete to help with code, but the punchline reveals it's completing a resignation letter, suggesting the developer's frustration with their tools has reached an extreme level.

- text: Stack traces are just error messages with trust issues—they need to tell you EVERYTHING.
  explanation: This aphorism personifies stack traces as overly talkative, comparing their detailed output to someone who over-explains due to trust issues. The humor comes from the relatable experience of wading through verbose error messages.

- text: Why don't debuggers make good friends? They always break when you need them most.
  explanation: This plays on the double meaning of "break" (both breakpoints in debugging and the failure of friendships) while also referencing the frustrating reality that debugging tools sometimes fail or behave unexpectedly during critical moments.

- text: My linter is passive-aggressive. It doesn't stop me, just judges silently with yellow squiggles.
  explanation: This personifies linters with a specific personality type, using the visual metaphor of warning indicators (yellow squiggles) as silent judgment. It captures the experience of being constantly reminded of code imperfections without enforcement.

- text: Version control is just Ctrl+Z with commitment issues.
  explanation: This aphorism uses incongruity by comparing sophisticated version control systems to a simple undo function, while adding the twist that version control actually commits changes permanently, creating a paradoxical "commitment issues" joke.

- text: Why did the developer break up with their debugger? It kept bringing up old breakpoints.
  explanation: This uses relationship metaphor to describe the debugging experience, where "bringing up old breakpoints" works both literally (debugging old code sections) and metaphorically (like bringing up past issues in relationships).

- text: My code formatter and I have different definitions of beauty. Mine is wrong, apparently.
  explanation: This self-deprecating joke captures the universal experience of code formatters changing your carefully crafted formatting, using the philosophical concept of beauty to frame the conflict between human and automated preferences.

- text: Profilers are like fitness trackers for code—they make you feel bad about things you didn't know were problems.
  explanation: This analogy creates humor through comparison, highlighting how both profilers and fitness trackers reveal uncomfortable truths about performance we'd rather not face, creating a sense of superiority theory (we laugh at our own inadequacy).

- text: Why did the memory profiler go to the doctor? It couldn't stop leaking information.
  explanation: This joke uses wordplay on "memory leak" (a programming bug) and "leaking information" (revealing secrets), creating a medical scenario where the profiler itself has the problem it's designed to detect.

- text: Git blame is the only tool where the name perfectly describes the user experience.
  explanation: This aphorism uses meta-humor about naming conventions, pointing out the ironic accuracy of "git blame" as both a technical command and an emotional response to finding problematic code, creating humor through truth-telling.

- text: My test coverage tool is an optimist—it thinks 47% is "almost there."
  explanation: This personifies testing tools with human personality traits, using the incongruity between objective metrics and subjective interpretation to highlight developers' tendency to rationalize insufficient test coverage.

- text: Why don't compilers tell jokes? Their timing is always off by one.
  explanation: This joke plays on the classic "off-by-one error" bug while also referencing comedic timing. The meta-humor comes from a joke about why compilers can't joke, while itself being a joke about compiler errors.

- text: Debuggers are like GPS—they're great at telling you where you went wrong, terrible at preventing it.
  explanation: This analogy creates humor through comparison and truth-telling. Both tools excel at post-mortem analysis but offer little preventive value, capturing a frustrating aspect of development tools through a relatable everyday comparison.

- text: Why did the developer install a package manager for their life? Because manually downloading happiness wasn't scalable.
  explanation: This joke applies technical concepts (package managers, scalability) to life problems, creating absurdist humor by treating emotional wellbeing as a dependency management problem, while also commenting on developer lifestyle.

- text: My terminal has better memory than me—it autocompletes my mistakes from 2019.
  explanation: This uses self-deprecating humor and personification, highlighting how command history can be both helpful and embarrassing. The specific year adds authenticity and emphasizes the long memory of development tools.

- text: Why did the regex tester need a vacation? It was exhausted from matching everyone's expectations.
  explanation: This uses sophisticated wordplay on "matching" (both regex pattern matching and meeting expectations) while personifying the tool as burned out, creating humor through the absurdity of an overworked testing utility.

- text: Docker containers are just trust issues for your code—"I don't care what works on YOUR machine."
  explanation: This aphorism brilliantly reframes the famous "works on my machine" problem as containerization having trust issues, using personification to explain a complex technical solution through psychological humor while capturing the entire purpose of Docker.

- text: Why did the build tool go to anger management? It kept throwing exceptions at everyone's commits.
  explanation: This multi-layered joke uses "throwing exceptions" both literally (programming errors) and figuratively (having outbursts), while the continuous integration context (commits) adds another layer, creating humor through the personification of an overly aggressive build system.

- text: My code review tool doesn't have opinions, it has "strongly-typed suggestions"—and they're all breaking changes.
  explanation: This sophisticated joke layers multiple programming concepts: "strongly-typed" (type systems), "breaking changes" (version incompatibility), and "suggestions" (code review comments), creating humor by treating code review feedback as if it were a type system that forces compliance, capturing the sometimes dictatorial nature of automated review tools.
