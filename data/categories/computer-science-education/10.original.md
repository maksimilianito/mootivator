- text: "My CS professor said to always comment my code. So I wrote '// good luck' at the top."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the expectation that code comments should explain functionality, but instead offers a darkly humorous warning about code quality. It's self-deprecating humor about writing unclear code."

- text: "Computer Science education: where you learn 50 sorting algorithms but never how to center a div."
  explanation: "This highlights the incongruity between academic CS curricula focused on theoretical algorithms versus practical web development skills that students actually need in real jobs."

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to class? To reach higher-level programming languages."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'higher-level' programming languages, playing with the literal interpretation of 'higher' as physical height versus abstraction level in programming."

- text: "My data structures professor asked if I understood recursion. I said I'd understand it once I understood recursion."
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates recursion through its own structure - the answer refers back to itself, mirroring the concept being explained. It's meta-humor about a fundamental CS concept."

- text: "CS degree: four years and $100k to learn what Stack Overflow could teach you in four months."
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke that pokes fun at the value proposition of formal CS education versus self-learning online, reflecting a common debate in the tech community."

- text: "In my algorithms class, we spent three weeks on Big O notation. It was O(nÂ³) boring."
  explanation: "Uses Big O notation (algorithm complexity) to describe the boredom level of the class itself, applying technical concepts to everyday experiences in a meta way."

- text: "Why don't CS students ever finish their degrees? They keep getting stuck in infinite loops of prerequisites."
  explanation: "Applies the programming concept of infinite loops to the bureaucratic reality of university course requirements, where prerequisites can sometimes create circular dependencies."

- text: "My professor said 'garbage collection' and half the class started cleaning their desks."
  explanation: "A misdirection joke where non-CS students interpret 'garbage collection' literally while CS students understand it as memory management, highlighting the dual meaning of technical terminology."

- text: "Academic CS: where you prove sorting takes O(n log n) time. Industry: where you just import the library."
  explanation: "Contrasts the theoretical, proof-based approach of academia with the practical, pragmatic approach of industry development, highlighting a common tension in CS education."

- text: "I asked my CS advisor about work-life balance. He said, 'That's a feature we haven't implemented yet.'"
  explanation: "Uses software development terminology ('feature,' 'implemented') to comment on the notorious lack of work-life balance in CS programs, treating it as a missing software feature."

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include philosophy? So students could ponder 'Why is my code not working?' on a deeper level."
  explanation: "Plays with the expectation that philosophy would address deep existential questions, but instead applies it to the mundane but frustrating experience of debugging."

- text: "Our operating systems professor taught us about deadlocks by making the final exam a prerequisite for the midterm."
  explanation: "Uses the concept of deadlock (circular dependency in computing) to create an absurd academic scenario, demonstrating the concept through the structure of the joke itself."

- text: "CS graduation requirements: 120 credits, 4 years, and the ability to explain to your parents what you actually do."
  explanation: "The relief theory at work - acknowledging the difficulty CS students face in explaining their technical work to non-technical family members, a universal experience."

- text: "My machine learning professor said grades would be curved. Turns out he meant sigmoid function curved, so everyone still failed."
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke requiring knowledge of sigmoid functions (which don't significantly boost low values), subverting expectations about grade curves helping students."

- text: "Why do CS students make terrible historians? They think anything before Git was prehistoric."
  explanation: "Plays on the temporal context of modern development tools, suggesting CS students lack historical perspective because version control (Git) is so fundamental to their worldview."

- text: "Our capstone project requirements: 'Build something innovative.' Our actual project: Todo list app #47,892."
  explanation: "Highlights the gap between ambitious academic expectations and the reality that students often build the same basic projects, using the specific number for comedic effect."

- text: "I told my CS professor I couldn't attend class due to a stack overflow. He asked if I tried increasing the recursion limit or my commitment."
  explanation: "Double meaning joke where 'stack overflow' could mean a technical error or browsing Stack Overflow, with the professor's response applying technical solutions to a social problem."

- text: "Why did the theoretical CS student refuse to date? They were still trying to prove P=NP, claiming 'If I can verify she likes me in polynomial time, surely I can find out in polynomial time.'"
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke about one of CS's most famous unsolved problems (P vs NP), absurdly applying it to dating, requiring deep theoretical CS knowledge to fully appreciate."

- text: "Our compiler design course final: write a compiler. Our actual submission: a Python script that prints 'Hello World' and a 50-page report explaining why that's technically a compiler."
  explanation: "Satirizes the gap between ambitious course projects and student reality, while also playfully engaging with the philosophical question of what constitutes a compiler."

- text: "Why was the CS curriculum committee stuck in an infinite loop? Because while(they.canAddMoreMath()) { they.addMoreMath(); } and the condition never returned false."
  explanation: "Uses actual code structure to tell the joke about CS programs adding endless math requirements, with the humor emerging from the logical structure itself."

- text: "My CS education taught me that every problem can be solved with the right algorithm. My career taught me that every problem can be solved by asking someone who solved it on Stack Overflow in 2013, whose account is now deleted, whose solution no longer works with current library versions, and whose approach violates three company policies."
  explanation: "A long-form joke that builds layers of increasingly specific frustrations, subverting the idealistic academic view with the messy reality of professional development, using the structure itself to create escalating humor."
