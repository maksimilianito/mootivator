- text: "Cache coherency protocols: where everyone agrees to disagree, but in perfect synchronization."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the paradox of cache coherency - multiple caches must maintain consistent data while operating independently, creating an apparent contradiction between disagreement and synchronization."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CPU go to therapy? It had too many pipeline hazards."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure with wordplay on 'hazards' - in computer architecture, pipeline hazards are technical obstacles, but the joke anthropomorphizes the CPU as having psychological problems."
  rating: 6

- text: "My CPU has trust issues. It always needs a second opinion from the branch predictor."
  explanation: "This joke personifies the CPU and plays on branch prediction, a technique where the processor guesses which way a conditional branch will go, framing it as seeking validation."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a CPU's favorite type of music? Heavy metal with good throughput."
  explanation: "This combines the physical nature of processors (metal) with the performance metric of throughput, creating a double meaning that works both literally and technically."
  rating: 5

- text: "I told my computer to optimize itself. Now it's in an infinite loop of self-improvement."
  explanation: "This plays on the concept of optimization creating a paradox - the pursuit of perfect optimization becomes its own bottleneck, referencing the halting problem indirectly."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't memory hierarchies ever win arguments? They always cache their concerns instead of addressing them."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'cache' (store temporarily) versus expressing concerns, and 'addressing' which means both dealing with issues and memory addressing."
  rating: 8

- text: "My processor is so out-of-order, it finished tomorrow's tasks yesterday."
  explanation: "This references out-of-order execution, where instructions complete in a different sequence than programmed, taken to an absurd time-traveling extreme."
  rating: 9

- text: "What did the TLB say to the page table? 'I've got you cached, no need to look that up.'"
  explanation: "This personifies the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and page table relationship, playing on both caching and the colloquial phrase 'I've got you covered.'"
  rating: 6

- text: "A RISC processor and a CISC processor walk into a bar. The RISC processor orders quickly. The CISC processor is still reading the menu."
  explanation: "This contrasts RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) with CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) philosophies - RISC has fewer, simpler instructions while CISC has many complex ones."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the superscalar processor break up with its girlfriend? She said it was too committed to multiple relationships at once."
  explanation: "Superscalar processors execute multiple instructions simultaneously (instruction-level parallelism), humorously framed as relationship infidelity."
  rating: 7

- text: "My CPU's branch predictor is so good, it predicted I'd make this joke before I thought of it."
  explanation: "This is meta-humor about branch prediction, which guesses future program behavior, taken to an absurd level of predicting human creativity."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a cache miss and my love life? The cache miss eventually gets resolved."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor using the technical term 'cache miss' (failed cache lookup that must go to slower memory) as a metaphor for romantic failure."
  rating: 6

- text: "I asked my processor why it was so hot. It said, 'I'm just working through some thermal throttling issues.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes thermal management - when processors get too hot, they reduce performance (throttle) to cool down, framed as personal problems."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why do computer architects love elevators? They understand the importance of a good cache hierarchy."
  explanation: "This creates an analogy between elevator systems (multiple levels of access) and memory hierarchies (L1, L2, L3 cache, RAM, disk), both optimizing access to different levels."
  rating: 6

- text: "A programmer dies and meets God. God says, 'You can ask me one question about the universe.' The programmer asks, 'What's the optimal cache replacement policy?' God replies, 'LRU works pretty well.' The programmer responds, 'That's what I thought, but what about Belady's algorithm?' God sighs, 'That's why you're here and not designing my universe.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke references cache replacement policies (LRU - Least Recently Used, and Belady's optimal algorithm which requires future knowledge), playing on the impossibility of perfect optimization."
  rating: 9

- text: "My CPU has imposter syndrome. Despite executing billions of instructions per second, it still thinks it's not doing enough."
  explanation: "This combines modern psychological concepts with CPU performance metrics, creating humor through anthropomorphization and the absurdity of such high performance being insufficient."
  rating: 8

- text: "What did the memory controller say during its performance review? 'I've been working on reducing my latency, but my bandwidth keeps getting in the way.'"
  explanation: "This personifies the memory controller and plays on the technical trade-off between latency (time to first byte) and bandwidth (total throughput), framed as workplace performance issues."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the speculative execution unit get fired? It kept doing work that nobody asked for, then had to undo everything when it turned out to be wrong."
  explanation: "This references speculative execution (executing instructions before knowing if they're needed) and the Spectre/Meltdown vulnerabilities, framed as workplace incompetence."
  rating: 8

- text: "A cache, a register, and RAM walk into a bar. The bartender serves the register immediately, makes the cache wait a few cycles, and tells RAM to come back tomorrow."
  explanation: "This joke illustrates the memory hierarchy through a bar scenario - registers are fastest (immediate), cache is fast (few cycles), and RAM is slow (many cycles), using temporal delays as the punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "My processor tried to implement Tomasulo's algorithm in its personal life. Now it has a reservation station for every social commitment and still can't figure out which one to execute first."
  explanation: "This applies Tomasulo's algorithm (out-of-order execution with reservation stations) to life planning, creating humor through the absurdity of over-engineering simple decisions."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do computer architects make terrible comedians? Because when they finally deliver the punchline after a 20-stage pipeline, the audience has already forgotten the setup, and half the jokes got flushed due to branch misprediction anyway."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses deep pipeline concepts (many stages between fetch and execution), branch misprediction (wrong guesses requiring pipeline flush), and instruction latency to explain why the joke itself fails - making it succeed through self-aware irony about computer architecture's complexity."
