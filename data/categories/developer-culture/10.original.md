- text: "Our standup meetings are so long, we've started calling them 'sit-down meetings.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony of 'standup' meetings (meant to be brief, daily check-ins where people literally stand to keep them short) becoming so lengthy that the physical act of standing becomes impractical. It reflects a common workplace frustration where meetings expand beyond their intended scope."

- text: "Why do developers prefer working from home? Because the commute from bed to desk has zero latency."
  explanation: "This uses technical terminology ('latency' - delay in data transmission) applied to physical movement, creating incongruity. It also touches on the stereotype of developers prioritizing efficiency and the remote work culture."

- text: "Our team's definition of 'legacy code' is anything written before lunch."
  explanation: "This exaggerates how quickly code becomes outdated or unwanted in developer culture. 'Legacy code' typically refers to old, difficult-to-maintain code, but here it's humorously applied to code that's only hours old, reflecting the fast pace and constant refactoring in development."

- text: "I'm not procrastinating, I'm just running extensive background processes."
  explanation: "This reframes procrastination using computer terminology, where 'background processes' are legitimate system operations. It's a humorous excuse that plays on the superiority theory - developers justifying their behavior with technical language."

- text: "Why did the developer get kicked out of the library? He kept trying to check out books using git pull."
  explanation: "This applies version control terminology (git pull, which retrieves code updates) to a non-technical context. The incongruity between software commands and library procedures creates the humor."

- text: "Our code review process is simple: if it works, we're suspicious."
  explanation: "This inverts normal expectations - usually working code is good. It reflects the paranoid culture in development where working code on the first try seems too good to be true, suggesting hidden bugs."

- text: "How do you know if someone is a senior developer? Don't worry, they'll tell you about all the frameworks they've seen die."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'how do you know someone is X' joke format while highlighting how senior developers have witnessed multiple technology cycles, often becoming somewhat cynical about new trends."

- text: "My rubber duck debugging has evolved. Now I have a therapy duck, an architecture duck, and a 'why am I doing this' duck."
  explanation: "Rubber duck debugging is a real technique where developers explain code to an inanimate object. This escalates the concept humorously, suggesting developers need emotional support beyond just technical problem-solving."

- text: "Why don't programmers like nature? Too many bugs and no stack traces."
  explanation: "This creates a double meaning with 'bugs' (insects vs. software errors) and highlights that nature doesn't provide the debugging tools (stack traces) that programmers rely on, making it uncomfortable for them."

- text: "We don't have technical debt. We have a technical mortgage with adjustable interest rates."
  explanation: "This escalates the financial metaphor of 'technical debt' (shortcuts that must be fixed later) to something more serious and ongoing, reflecting how technical problems compound over time like real financial obligations."

- text: "The three stages of debugging: 1) That can't happen. 2) That shouldn't happen. 3) Why is that happening?"
  explanation: "This captures the psychological journey developers experience when encountering bugs, moving from denial through confusion to desperate investigation. It's relatable to anyone who's debugged code."

- text: "Our company's 'move fast and break things' motto has evolved into 'move cautiously and fix things.'"
  explanation: "This references Facebook's famous motto while showing the maturity arc of tech companies - from reckless innovation to responsible maintenance, often learned through painful experience."

- text: "Why did the startup founder bring a ladder to the meeting? To reach the next level of disruption."
  explanation: "This mocks startup culture's obsession with buzzwords like 'disruption' and 'next level' by literalizing the metaphor, creating absurdity through the physical ladder prop."

- text: "I told my manager I needed two weeks to refactor. He gave me two days and called it 'agile.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes how management often misunderstands or misapplies agile methodology, using it as justification for unrealistic timelines rather than its intended purpose of flexibility and quality."

- text: "Our office has a ping-pong table, free snacks, and mandatory overtime. We call it 'work-life integration.'"
  explanation: "This critiques tech company culture that offers perks while demanding excessive hours, using the euphemism 'work-life integration' instead of the healthier 'work-life balance' - revealing the true imbalance."

- text: "How many developers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that's a hardware problem."
  explanation: "This plays on the classic light bulb joke format while highlighting the tribal divisions in tech between software and hardware, and developers' tendency to deflect problems outside their domain."

- text: "We practice continuous deployment. Mainly because our staging environment is production."
  explanation: "This dark humor reveals a dangerous but surprisingly common practice where companies skip proper testing environments, making every deployment a risky live experiment. The casual admission makes it funnier."

- text: "Why do developers love coffee? Because it's the only dependency that actually speeds things up."
  explanation: "This uses programming terminology ('dependency' - external code libraries) to describe coffee, creating a parallel between software dependencies (which often slow development) and caffeine (which accelerates it)."

- text: "Our team building exercise was debugging together in production. Nothing builds trust like shared panic."
  explanation: "This subverts the concept of typical team building activities by describing an actual crisis situation. The phrase 'shared panic' perfectly captures the bonding that happens during production emergencies."

- text: "I'm not antisocial. I'm just waiting for someone to send a proper meeting request with an agenda."
  explanation: "This reframes introversion or meeting avoidance as a legitimate technical complaint about process. It reflects developers' preference for structured, purposeful communication over spontaneous interaction."

- text: "Why did the developer refuse the promotion to management? He didn't want to trade his compiler errors for human errors. At least compiler errors make sense."
  explanation: "This captures the common developer fear of management roles, contrasting the logical, fixable nature of code problems with the illogical, messy nature of people problems. The final sentence delivers the punchline that human behavior is more unpredictable and frustrating than any bug."
