- text: "I entered a coding competition and got third place. Turns out, arrays start at zero."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the programming concept that arrays are zero-indexed in most languages. The humor comes from applying this technical detail to real-world placement, suggesting the coder actually came in first place (position 0) but misunderstood the counting system."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer fail the coding challenge? He couldn't find the right algorithm, but he found plenty of wrong ones."
  explanation: "This joke uses the common programming experience of trial and error. The humor lies in the literal interpretation of the search process - finding many incorrect solutions is actually part of the problem-solving journey, but framed as a failure."
  rating: 5

- text: "My solution to the coding puzzle was O(n!). The exclamation mark wasn't for factorial."
  explanation: "This joke relies on double meaning - O(n!) represents factorial time complexity (extremely inefficient), but the exclamation mark also expresses shock or dismay. The humor comes from acknowledging both the terrible performance and the emotional reaction to it."
  rating: 9

- text: "I solved the algorithmic challenge in constant time. Constantly timing out, that is."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'constant time' (O(1) complexity, the most efficient) versus 'constantly' (repeatedly). The misdirection creates humor by first suggesting success, then revealing repeated failure."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite coding competition? The one where they copy-paste from Stack Overflow fastest."
  explanation: "This joke pokes fun at the common (though frowned upon) practice of using Stack Overflow solutions during competitions. The humor comes from the superiority theory - we laugh at the absurd extreme of what's sometimes a real temptation."
  rating: 6

- text: "I optimized my solution from O(n²) to O(2ⁿ). I'm going backwards faster than ever!"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony of 'optimization' actually making things exponentially worse. Exponential complexity O(2ⁿ) is much worse than quadratic O(n²), creating humor through the absurdity of proud incompetence."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do coding competitions always have time limits? Because without them, we'd still be debugging our first submission."
  explanation: "This uses relief theory - acknowledging the universal programmer experience of endless debugging. The humor comes from the relatable truth that perfectionism and bug-fixing can be infinite without external constraints."
  rating: 7

- text: "My divide-and-conquer strategy worked perfectly. I divided my time between panicking and conquering the snack table."
  explanation: "This joke reframes a famous algorithmic strategy (divide-and-conquer) in the context of competition stress. The misdirection from technical approach to stress-eating creates the comedic effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally solved the dynamic programming challenge! It only took me three competitions and two career changes."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the notorious difficulty of dynamic programming problems. The humor comes from the absurd time scale, suggesting someone literally changed careers (twice!) while trying to understand one concept."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a coding puzzle and a Rubik's cube? With a Rubik's cube, you can eventually give up and peel off the stickers."
  explanation: "This comparison highlights the frustration of algorithmic challenges where there's no 'cheating' option. The humor lies in the desperate desire for shortcuts when facing difficult problems."
  rating: 6

- text: "I entered a recursion competition. I entered a recursion competition. I entered a recursion competition..."
  explanation: "This joke embodies recursion by literally repeating itself, creating meta-humor. It's both a demonstration of the concept and a joke about being stuck in recursive loops."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the programmer bring a ladder to the coding competition? He heard the problems had multiple levels."
  explanation: "This uses literal interpretation of 'levels' (difficulty tiers) as physical levels requiring a ladder. The absurdist approach creates humor through incongruity between technical and physical worlds."
  rating: 4

- text: "My greedy algorithm worked great. I greedily took all the easy test cases and ignored the hard ones."
  explanation: "This reinterprets the 'greedy algorithm' concept (making locally optimal choices) as actually being selfish and lazy. The humor comes from applying the technical term to unethical competition behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "I solved the graph traversal problem using BFS. Brute Force Search."
  explanation: "This plays on the acronym BFS (Breadth-First Search, a legitimate algorithm) by redefining it as 'Brute Force Search,' an unsophisticated approach. The humor comes from the misdirection and the truth that sometimes brute force is tempting."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a programmer who finishes a coding challenge early? A liar."
  explanation: "This cynical joke uses the superiority theory, suggesting that anyone claiming to finish early is either lying or missed something. The blunt delivery enhances the comedic effect."
  rating: 6

- text: "I implemented a backtracking solution. Mainly because I kept having to backtrack through my logic errors."
  explanation: "This double meaning joke uses 'backtracking' both as an algorithm technique and as literally going back to fix mistakes. The self-deprecating humor makes it relatable."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why are coding competitions like dating? You spend hours trying to impress someone, only to get rejected with 'Wrong Answer.'"
  explanation: "This analogy between competition feedback and romantic rejection creates humor through unexpected comparison. The technical term 'Wrong Answer' becomes emotionally loaded in the dating context."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code passed all sample test cases. Then the hidden test cases arrived like the Spanish Inquisition."
  explanation: "This references the famous Monty Python sketch while capturing the universal experience of failing hidden tests. The unexpected failure creates both the humor and the pain."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote a solution so elegant, so perfect, so beautiful. Then I hit submit and got Memory Limit Exceeded."
  explanation: "This builds up expectations of success only to deflate them with a common competition failure. The contrast between aesthetic code quality and practical performance creates the comedic tension."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a competitive programmer's favorite exercise? Running through test cases. It's the only running they do."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke plays on the sedentary stereotype of programmers while using 'running' in both its technical sense (executing) and physical sense (exercise)."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally understand competitive programming: It's where you speedrun anxiety while your code speedruns into segmentation faults."
  explanation: "This modern joke uses 'speedrun' (gaming term for completing something quickly) in parallel construction - both the programmer and code are racing, but toward different outcomes. The sophisticated wordplay and relatability make it the peak of the collection."
