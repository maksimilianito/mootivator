- text: "My database has trust issues—it won't accept any relationships without a foreign key."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'relationships' (both personal trust and database table relationships) and 'foreign key' (a database constraint that ensures referential integrity). The humor comes from anthropomorphizing the database with human emotional characteristics."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the DBA go to therapy? Too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure with 'dependencies' having a double meaning—both psychological issues in therapy and database table dependencies. The incongruity comes from applying database terminology to mental health."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my database a joke, but it didn't laugh. No sense of HUMOR column."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'HUMOR' as both a human quality and a potential database column name. The joke uses the technical concept that databases only contain what's explicitly defined in their schema."
  rating: 5

- text: "SQL walks into a bar, sees two tables, and asks: 'May I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This personifies SQL and uses the double meaning of 'JOIN'—both a social request and the SQL operation that combines data from multiple tables. It's a classic misdirection pattern."
  rating: 9

- text: "My database administrator is a great gardener—he's always pruning indexes."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the unexpected connection between database maintenance (index optimization) and gardening. The word 'pruning' works in both contexts, creating a bridge between two unrelated domains."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? They always show their keys."
  explanation: "This plays on 'keys' as both poker terminology (showing your cards) and database keys (primary and foreign keys). The incongruity comes from applying database behavior to a card game scenario."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my database for advice. It said: 'NULL and void.'"
  explanation: "A wordplay joke combining the legal phrase 'null and void' with the database concept of NULL values (representing missing data). The double meaning creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "The database went on a diet—now it only accepts normalized data."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes databases and plays on 'normalized' as both a health/diet term and the technical process of database normalization (organizing data to reduce redundancy)."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the NoSQL database break up with the relational database? It needed some space—and schema flexibility."
  explanation: "This joke uses relationship metaphors to explain technical differences between NoSQL and relational databases, with 'needing space' working both as a breakup cliche and a reference to NoSQL's schemaless nature."
  rating: 8

- text: "My database has commitment issues. Every transaction ends with ROLLBACK."
  explanation: "This combines relationship psychology with database transaction management. ROLLBACK is a SQL command that undoes changes, creating humor through the parallel with someone who can't commit to decisions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A DBA's favorite pickup line: 'Are you a database? Because I'd like to establish a connection.'"
  explanation: "This uses the database concept of 'establishing a connection' (connecting to a database server) in a romantic context, creating humor through the awkward application of technical terminology to dating."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the database administrator stay calm during the outage? He had a backup plan—literally."
  explanation: "This plays on 'backup plan' as both a colloquial expression for contingency planning and the literal database backups that DBAs maintain. The humor comes from the double meaning being made explicit."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to organize a database administrators' party, but nobody came. They were all afraid of a deadlock situation."
  explanation: "This uses 'deadlock' (a database condition where transactions block each other indefinitely) as a metaphor for social awkwardness. The joke suggests DBAs would avoid situations that resemble their worst technical nightmares."
  rating: 9

- text: "The database proposed to its administrator: 'Will you be my primary key? Because you're unique and I can't function without you.'"
  explanation: "This creates romantic humor by using the technical properties of a primary key (uniqueness and necessity) as compliments. It's a layered joke that works both technically and emotionally."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do databases make terrible comedians? Their jokes are too normalized—all the redundancy has been removed."
  explanation: "This meta-humor joke explains why database jokes might not be funny by using the concept of normalization (removing redundant data). The irony is that repetition is often key to comedy, but databases eliminate it."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and says: 'Mind if I run a CROSS JOIN?' They replied: 'Sure, but it's going to get messy—we're talking Cartesian product levels of chaos here.'"
  explanation: "This extended joke uses the CROSS JOIN operation (which creates every possible combination of rows from two tables) as a metaphor for social chaos. The technical accuracy adds authenticity while the scenario is absurdly social."
  rating: 8

- text: "My database has impostor syndrome. It keeps saying: 'I'm just a collection of tables pretending to be a system.'"
  explanation: "This applies the modern psychological concept of impostor syndrome to databases, creating humor through the absurdity of a database having existential doubts about its own architecture."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the database refuse to go to the party? It said: 'I can't handle that many concurrent connections—my maximum pool size is already reached, and honestly, I'm not good with transactions after 11 PM.'"
  explanation: "This elaborate joke anthropomorphizes database connection limits and transaction management as social anxiety and tiredness. Multiple technical concepts (connection pooling, concurrency, transactions) are woven into a relatable social scenario."
  rating: 9

- text: "A junior developer asked the senior DBA: 'Why do you talk to the database so gently?' The DBA replied: 'Because one wrong command and it drops everything.'"
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'drops' (both emotionally dropping/giving up and the SQL DROP command that deletes database objects). The humor comes from treating the database like a sensitive person who might have an extreme reaction."
  rating: 10

- text: "The database filed a complaint with HR: 'My administrator keeps calling me 'legacy' and threatens to migrate me to the cloud. I feel like I'm being phased out.' HR responded: 'Have you tried updating your schema?'"
  explanation: "This creates a complete absurdist scenario where a database has employment concerns and HR applies technical solutions to emotional problems. Multiple layers of humor include ageism in tech, cloud migration trends, and the uselessness of HR's technical advice for emotional issues."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the database go to existential philosophy class? It was having an identity crisis—it couldn't decide if it was ACID-compliant or eventually consistent, whether relationships were real or just foreign key constraints, and if NULL truly meant nothing or just the absence of something. The professor said: 'Sounds like you need to find your schema and stick with it.'"
  explanation: "This complex joke combines database theory (ACID properties vs. eventual consistency, the nature of NULL values) with philosophical questions about existence and meaning. The professor's advice to 'find your schema' works both as life advice and technical guidance, creating a sophisticated multi-layered punchline that satirizes both philosophy and database architecture debates."
