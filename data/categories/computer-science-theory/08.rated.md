- text: "I tried to prove P=NP, but my proof had O(n!) complexity."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that attempting to solve the most famous problem in computer science (P=NP) resulted in factorial time complexity, which is one of the worst possible complexities - the opposite of what you'd want to prove."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Turing machine go to therapy? It couldn't decide if it would halt."
  explanation: "This references the halting problem, one of the fundamental undecidable problems in computer science. The joke anthropomorphizes the machine's theoretical inability to determine if it will halt as an existential crisis requiring therapy."
  rating: 8

- text: "My algorithm is so efficient, it finishes before it starts. Unfortunately, that violates causality."
  explanation: "This plays with the absurdity of claiming negative time complexity, which would be physically impossible. It's a humorous exaggeration of optimization obsession."
  rating: 6

- text: "Quantum computing: where your algorithm is both correct and incorrect until someone checks your output."
  explanation: "This jokes about quantum superposition applied to algorithms, playing on Schr√∂dinger's cat and the uncertainty inherent in quantum computing until measurement occurs."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a recursive function to understand recursion. Now I'm stuck in a stack overflow."
  explanation: "This is meta-humor about recursion that demonstrates the very problem it describes - getting trapped in infinite recursion, resulting in stack overflow."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do computer scientists confuse Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25."
  explanation: "This classic joke uses the mathematical fact that 31 in octal (base 8) equals 25 in decimal (base 10), creating incongruity between calendar dates and number systems."
  rating: 9

- text: "My thesis proved that all problems are NP-complete. The proof? It's too complex to verify, therefore NP-complete."
  explanation: "This is self-referential humor about NP-completeness, where the joke itself demonstrates the property it claims to prove - being hard to verify."
  rating: 9

- text: "I optimized my sorting algorithm to O(1). Turns out, it just returns the input unsorted."
  explanation: "This satirizes the obsession with Big O notation by presenting a 'solution' that achieves perfect complexity by not actually solving the problem."
  rating: 8

- text: "A logician's spouse says 'Go to the store and get a loaf of bread. If they have eggs, get a dozen.' The logician returns with 12 loaves of bread."
  explanation: "This exploits the ambiguity between natural language and formal logic. The logician interpreted 'get a dozen' as referring to bread, not eggs, following strict logical parsing."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the automaton refuse to accept the string? It had commitment issues with final states."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes finite automata, turning the technical concept of accepting strings by reaching final states into a relationship problem."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally understood lambda calculus. Then I tried to explain it and reduced myself to confusion."
  explanation: "This plays on 'reduction' in lambda calculus while describing the common experience of understanding something until you try to explain it."
  rating: 7

- text: "My graph algorithm found the shortest path. It was zero edges. Turns out I never left the starting node."
  explanation: "This jokes about edge cases in graph algorithms, where the technically correct answer (zero distance from a node to itself) is absurdly unhelpful."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why are complexity theorists bad at relationships? They're always trying to reduce their partners to simpler problems."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'reduction' in complexity theory (transforming one problem to another) and relationship dynamics."
  rating: 7

- text: "I proved my algorithm terminates. The proof was by intimidation - nobody dared question it."
  explanation: "This references 'proof by intimidation,' an informal fallacy in mathematics, applying it humorously to algorithm analysis."
  rating: 8

- text: "A programmer's partner asks: 'Do you love me or your algorithms more?' The programmer responds: 'That's not a decidable question.'"
  explanation: "This applies the concept of undecidability to a relationship question, treating an emotional query as a formal computational problem."
  rating: 8

- text: "My neural network learned to prove theorems. First theorem it proved: 'This network is overfitted.'"
  explanation: "This is self-referential humor where the AI's first discovery is about its own limitation, demonstrating awareness of a common machine learning problem."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the computer scientist bring a ladder to the lecture? To reach higher-order functions."
  explanation: "This creates a physical metaphor for the abstract concept of higher-order functions in functional programming and lambda calculus."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked a complexity theorist if they wanted coffee or tea. Three hours later, they proved the question was NP-hard."
  explanation: "This satirizes the tendency to over-analyze simple problems using complex theoretical frameworks, turning a basic choice into a computational complexity problem."
  rating: 8

- text: "Two strings walk into a bar. The bartender says, 'We don't serve strings here.' The first string leaves. The second string ties itself in a knot, ruffles itself up, and walks back in. 'Aren't you a string?' asks the bartender. 'I'm a frayed knot,' it replies."
  explanation: "This is a play on 'afraid not' sounding like 'a frayed knot,' using string manipulation as a literal physical transformation to bypass a restriction."
  rating: 9

- text: "A Bayesian and a frequentist are trapped on a desert island. The Bayesian says, 'Based on my prior beliefs, we'll be rescued tomorrow.' The frequentist says, 'We need more data.' They're still there."
  explanation: "This contrasts two fundamental approaches to probability and statistics, highlighting the philosophical differences between Bayesian (prior beliefs) and frequentist (data-driven) methods through absurdist humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the type theorist break up with their partner? They said 'I love you,' but couldn't prove it was well-typed in the relationship context, and the dependent types kept changing. Plus, every time they tried to commit, the compiler said 'type mismatch: expected Ring, found String.'"
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke combines type theory concepts (well-typed, dependent types, type checking) with relationship metaphors, including a pun on 'Ring' (algebraic structure vs. engagement ring) and 'String' (data type vs. romantic entanglement), creating humor through the absurdity of applying formal verification to human emotions."
