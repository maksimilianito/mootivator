- text: "My CPU's branch predictor has a 99% accuracy rate. It's wrong exactly when I need it most."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Murphy's Law applied to computer architecture. Branch predictors are crucial for performance, but their rare misfires cause pipeline stalls at the most inconvenient times, creating an ironic twist about optimization failures."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the cache miss go to therapy? It had abandonment issues."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a cache miss, using psychological terminology to describe the technical concept of data not being present in cache memory. The 'abandonment' references data being evicted from cache."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to explain cache coherency to my friend. Now we're not on the same page."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'not on the same page' refers both to the idiom about disagreement and the literal memory pages that must be kept coherent in multi-core systems."
  rating: 9

- text: "The memory hierarchy walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll it be?' The register answers immediately. The RAM takes a moment. The hard drive says, 'I'll tell you next week.'"
  explanation: "This joke illustrates the latency differences in the memory hierarchy through a bar scene, with each level responding at speeds proportional to their actual access times."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't CPUs ever finish their sentences? Pipeline stallsâ€”"
  explanation: "The joke itself demonstrates a pipeline stall by interrupting mid-sentence, mimicking how CPUs halt execution when waiting for data or resolving branch mispredictions."
  rating: 10

- text: "My processor supports out-of-order execution. Explains why I finish projects before I start them."
  explanation: "This applies the CPU optimization technique of out-of-order execution to human behavior, creating an absurd scenario where effects precede causes."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a CPU's favorite exercise? Benchmarking. It's the only time it gets to show off without thermal throttling."
  explanation: "This personifies CPUs and references the ironic situation where processors perform best during short benchmarks but throttle during sustained workloads due to heat."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a love letter to my L1 cache. It was short, sweet, and had extremely low latency."
  explanation: "This uses romantic terminology to describe L1 cache characteristics: small size (short), valuable (sweet), and fast access times (low latency)."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the RISC processor break up with the CISC processor? Too many complex instructions in the relationship."
  explanation: "This plays on the fundamental architectural difference between RISC (Reduced Instruction Set) and CISC (Complex Instruction Set), applying it to relationship dynamics."
  rating: 7

- text: "My CPU has 64 cores but still can't handle my single-threaded emotional problems."
  explanation: "This highlights the limitation of parallel processing when dealing with inherently sequential tasks, using personal emotions as the metaphor for Amdahl's Law."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer's computer has 128GB of RAM. He opens Chrome. Now he has a space heater."
  explanation: "This exaggerates Chrome's notorious memory consumption while also referencing how excessive memory access increases power consumption and heat generation."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the CPU architect refuse to date? He said all relationships have too much overhead and not enough throughput."
  explanation: "This applies performance metrics (overhead and throughput) to romantic relationships, reflecting how architects think about system efficiency."
  rating: 7

- text: "The ALU, the control unit, and the registers walk into a bar. The bartender says, 'What is this, some kind of processor?'"
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke that references the three main components of a CPU, with the punchline acknowledging that these components literally make up a processor."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my computer to prefetch my future. It returned a segmentation fault."
  explanation: "This combines the optimization technique of prefetching with existential philosophy, suggesting that accessing one's future is an invalid memory operation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do memory controllers make terrible comedians? Their timing is always off by several nanoseconds."
  explanation: "This references the critical importance of precise timing in memory controllers, where even nanosecond-level variations can cause failures, applied to comedic timing."
  rating: 7

- text: "My processor has speculative execution. It's already disappointed by code I haven't written yet."
  explanation: "This personifies speculative execution (where CPUs execute instructions before knowing if they're needed) as pessimistic prediction about future code quality."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a cache hit and a cache miss? About 100 cycles of existential dread."
  explanation: "This quantifies the emotional impact of cache misses using actual technical metrics (CPU cycles), humorously equating performance penalties with psychological suffering."
  rating: 9

- text: "I optimized my code for the L1 cache. Now it runs so fast it finishes before I press Enter. I call it speculative programming."
  explanation: "This creates an absurd scenario combining cache optimization with speculative execution, suggesting code that violates causality through extreme performance."
  rating: 8

- text: "A CPU walks into a bar and orders 16 drinks in parallel. The bartender says, 'Sir, this is a sequential establishment.'"
  explanation: "This illustrates the concept of parallel processing versus sequential execution through a bar scene, highlighting the fundamental challenge of parallelizing inherently sequential tasks."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the computer architect get divorced? He kept trying to pipeline his marriage, but his spouse was a blocking operation."
  explanation: "This uses pipelining terminology to describe relationship dynamics, where one partner's sequential nature prevents the parallel processing the architect desires."
  rating: 8

- text: "My CPU has a 5-stage pipeline, 512KB L2 cache, and 3.2GHz clock speed. It still can't predict which line of code will make production crash at 3 AM on a Saturday."
  explanation: "This is the longest joke, building up impressive technical specifications only to deflate them with the reality that no amount of architectural sophistication can predict real-world software failures, combining technical detail with programmer's existential dread."
