- text: "C++ developers never break up—they just have pointer issues."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'pointer issues' - both relationship problems (pointing in different directions) and C++'s notorious pointer management challenges. It's a simple pun that works as a one-liner."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do Python programmers prefer snakes? They're already used to significant whitespace."
  explanation: "This references Python's unique use of indentation for code structure, creating an incongruity between the snake mascot and the language's syntax requirements."
  rating: 6

- text: "Java: Write once, debug everywhere."
  explanation: "A twist on Java's famous slogan 'Write once, run anywhere,' this joke uses misdirection to highlight the reality of cross-platform debugging challenges versus the marketing promise."
  rating: 9

- text: "A JavaScript developer walks into a bar, a restaurant, a bank, and a hospital. They're all the same single-page application."
  explanation: "This satirizes JavaScript's tendency to create overly complex SPAs for everything, using the classic 'walks into a bar' setup with an unexpected technical punchline."
  rating: 8

- text: "Rust developers don't have trust issues. They have ownership issues."
  explanation: "A play on Rust's ownership system, which is both the language's defining feature and its steepest learning curve, applied to human relationship terminology."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the PHP developer go to therapy? Too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "Double meaning between psychological issues (unresolved dependencies) and PHP's notorious dependency management problems, especially before Composer became standard."
  rating: 7

- text: "C programmers: 'I know exactly where my memory is.' Also C programmers: *segmentation fault*"
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory by showing the gap between C programmers' confidence in manual memory management and the reality of frequent crashes."
  rating: 8

- text: "Assembly language is the only language where 'Hello World' requires a PhD and three cups of coffee."
  explanation: "Exaggeration technique highlighting Assembly's notorious difficulty, even for the simplest programs, creating absurdist humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't Haskell programmers ever get angry? Because side effects are impure."
  explanation: "This jokes about Haskell's pure functional programming paradigm, where side effects (including emotions?) are avoided, creating a philosophical absurdity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Go developers: 'We don't need generics!' Also Go developers: *writes the same function 47 times*"
  explanation: "References the long-standing debate about Go's lack of generics (until recently), showing the contradiction between ideology and practice through exaggeration."
  rating: 8

- text: "A COBOL programmer dies and goes to heaven. God says, 'Welcome! We need you to maintain some legacy systems.' The programmer replies, 'So nothing's changed?'"
  explanation: "This uses the relief theory to address the eternal nature of COBOL maintenance work, with the punchline that even heaven has legacy systems."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Lisp programmer get lost? Too many parentheses, couldn't find the way out."
  explanation: "Visual joke about Lisp's infamous parentheses overload, creating a literal interpretation of being trapped in syntax."
  rating: 6

- text: "TypeScript: Because JavaScript developers finally admitted they need adult supervision."
  explanation: "Superiority theory humor that pokes fun at JavaScript's loose typing while acknowledging TypeScript as the mature solution."
  rating: 8

- text: "A Perl developer's code is like their handwriting—only they can read it, and even that's questionable after six months."
  explanation: "References Perl's reputation for write-only code, using a relatable analogy to handwriting that builds to a self-deprecating punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do Scala developers always look tired? They're still compiling yesterday's code."
  explanation: "Exaggeration of Scala's notoriously slow compilation times, using temporal absurdity for effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "Kotlin: Java's apology letter."
  explanation: "Short, punchy metaphor that captures Kotlin's role as fixing Java's shortcomings, using personification for humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "A Ruby developer, a Python developer, and a JavaScript developer walk into a bar. The Ruby developer orders a cocktail with exactly seven ingredients mixed in a very specific way. The Python developer orders whatever's on tap because it's simple and gets the job done. The JavaScript developer orders everything on the menu simultaneously because async/await."
  explanation: "This extended setup uses stereotypes about each language's philosophy—Ruby's elegance and complexity, Python's simplicity, and JavaScript's asynchronous chaos—building to a technical punchline."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the C# developer break up with Java? They found someone with better properties and didn't need to get() and set() everything explicitly."
  explanation: "Uses relationship metaphor to highlight C#'s syntactic improvements over Java's verbose getter/setter pattern, with double meaning on 'properties.'"
  rating: 8

- text: "Fortran: Proving that if something works, nobody will ever let you retire it. Somewhere, right now, a 60-year-old program is calculating rocket trajectories and judging your modern frameworks."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about legacy systems combined with personification, creating an absurd image of judgmental old code that's simultaneously more reliable than modern software."
  rating: 9

- text: "The programming language wars would end immediately if developers realized they're all just arguing about which way to suffer."
  explanation: "Philosophical aphorism that uses the relief theory to acknowledge the universal truth that all programming involves struggle, regardless of language choice."
  rating: 10

- text: "A C++ developer and a Rust developer got into an argument about memory safety. The C++ developer made some excellent points, but nobody could verify them because they'd already been deallocated. The Rust developer's arguments were still there, guaranteed by the borrow checker, but nobody could use them because they were already borrowed immutably by seventeen different threads of the conversation."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke creates parallel technical metaphors for each language's memory model applied to an actual argument, with layered humor that works on multiple levels—the C++ side references use-after-free bugs, while the Rust side satirizes the borrow checker's strictness that sometimes makes simple things complicated. The absurdity builds as the metaphor extends to threading concepts, creating a perfect storm of language war commentary."
