  explanation: "Exploits the double meaning of 'delivery' - both joke delivery and packet delivery - while referencing network latency, a common frustration in networking."
  rating: 8

- text: "I named my network 'FBI Surveillance Van #3'. Now my neighbors are more paranoid than my firewall."
  explanation: "A story-format joke that combines social engineering humor with network naming conventions, creating humor through the psychological impact of a clever SSID choice."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a network engineer's favorite dance? The handshake. But it always takes three steps."
  explanation: "References the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) while comparing it to dancing, demonstrating how technical protocols can be reimagined as social activities."

- text: "A router, a switch, and a hub walked into a bar. The hub started broadcasting everyone's conversation. The router said 'That's why nobody invites you anymore.'"
  explanation: "Personifies network devices while accurately depicting their behavior - hubs broadcast to all ports (inefficient) while routers and switches are more intelligent, creating humor through social ostracism based on technical limitations."
