- text: "CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, or as I call them, Constantly Struggling with Spacing."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the acronym CSS by creating an alternative meaning that reflects the common frustration web developers face when trying to get spacing and layout just right. The alliteration of 'Constantly Struggling' mirrors 'Cascading Style' making it memorable."

- text: "Why do web developers always carry a ladder? In case they need to reach the top of the DOM tree."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'tree' - both as a physical object you'd climb with a ladder, and the Document Object Model tree structure that represents HTML elements. The physical impossibility creates the humor."

- text: "My website is like my diet - I keep saying I'll optimize it tomorrow."
  explanation: "This joke uses the relatable human experience of procrastination, applying it to the technical concept of website optimization. It's self-deprecating humor that many developers will identify with."

- text: "HTML is like a loving relationship - you need strong tags to hold everything together."
  explanation: "The joke creates an unexpected parallel between HTML tags (which literally hold content together) and emotional bonds in relationships. The word 'tags' works both technically and metaphorically."

- text: "I told my browser to stop caching. It just couldn't let go of the past."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the browser, giving it emotional attachment issues. The technical concept of caching (storing old data) is reframed as an inability to move on emotionally."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#."
  explanation: "A classic programming pun that plays on the homophone of 'see' and 'C#' (another programming language). The setup about JavaScript makes the punchline unexpected since we're expecting a JavaScript-related answer."

- text: "My CSS is so specific, it knows what I'm going to style before I do."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the concept of CSS specificity (how the browser determines which styles to apply) to absurd levels, suggesting the code has psychic abilities. It also hints at overly-complex CSS selectors."

- text: "Why don't web developers like nature? Too many bugs and no way to inspect element."
  explanation: "This creates humor by applying web development tools and terminology to the natural world. The double meaning of 'bugs' (insects vs. code errors) and the impossibility of using browser dev tools in nature creates the incongruity."

- text: "I finally understood responsive design when my therapist said I needed to adapt to different viewports in life."
  explanation: "This joke elevates a technical concept (responsive design adapting to different screen sizes) to a life philosophy, creating an unexpected connection between web development and personal growth."

- text: "What's a web developer's favorite tea? Proper-tea. Especially the box-sizing property."
  explanation: "A multi-layered pun combining the homophone 'property/proper-tea' with a reference to the CSS box-sizing property, which is crucial for proper layout. The joke works on both a simple pun level and a technical reference level."

- text: "My JavaScript code is like my love life - full of promises that never resolve."
  explanation: "This uses the technical concept of JavaScript Promises (which can resolve or reject) as a metaphor for unfulfilled romantic commitments. The double meaning of 'resolve' makes it work on both levels."

- text: "Why did the div go to therapy? It had too many nested issues."
  explanation: "The word 'nested' works both as a technical term (HTML elements nested inside each other) and as 'nested issues' meaning deep-rooted problems. The anthropomorphization of a div element adds to the absurdity."

- text: "I don't always test my JavaScript, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme while highlighting the terrible practice of testing code in live production environments. The humor comes from admitting to a practice every developer knows is wrong but has probably done."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This personifies a SQL query and uses the technical term JOIN (which combines database tables) in its colloquial meaning of joining people socially. The setup mirrors classic 'walks into a bar' joke format."

- text: "Why do front-end developers eat lunch alone? Because they don't know how to JOIN tables, and back-end developers won't let them sit without proper authentication."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the rivalry between front-end and back-end developers, using technical concepts (SQL JOINs and authentication) as social barriers. It's a layered joke that works on multiple technical levels."

- text: "My relationship with JavaScript is complicated - it's asynchronous. I'm ready to commit, but it keeps saying 'callback later.'"
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly combines relationship terminology with JavaScript's asynchronous programming concepts. 'Commit' works as both a relationship term and a git/version control term, while 'callback' is both a technical function and a social promise."

- text: "I told my web page it needed to lose weight. It said 'Don't worry, I'm already on a strict byte diet.' I said 'That's not enough, you need to minify yourself.'"
  explanation: "This creates a conversation between developer and webpage, using weight-loss terminology alongside technical optimization terms. The progression from 'byte diet' (bytes being data units) to minification (code compression) shows escalating technical solutions to a metaphorical problem."

- text: "Why did the web developer break up with CSS? Because every time they tried to center their relationship, CSS said 'justify-content: space-between' and pushed them apart."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses the notorious difficulty of centering elements in CSS as a metaphor for relationship problems. The specific CSS property 'justify-content: space-between' literally means pushing elements to opposite ends, making it perfect for describing a failing relationship."

- text: "A web developer's last words: 'It works on my machine.' The coroner's report: 'Death by production environment.'"
  explanation: "This darkly humorous joke references the classic developer excuse 'it works on my machine' and the terror of code failing in production. The format mimics a crime scene report, elevating a common development problem to fatal consequences."

- text: "My code is like an onion - it has layers, it makes you cry, and the more you peel back, the worse it smells. But unlike an onion, it's not properly encapsulated."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor starts with a familiar Shrek reference but adds technical depth. The progression from emotional (crying) to sensory (smell) to technical (encapsulation) creates humor through escalation while making a point about code quality."

- text: "Three web developers walk into a bar. The first orders a beer. The second orders 0 beers. The third orders 999999999 beers. The bartender crashes, the bar catches fire, and somehow a user in production can't log in."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated joke about testing edge cases and how bugs in one system can cause unexpected failures elsewhere. It references boundary testing (0 and maximum values), system failures, and the mysterious ways production bugs manifest - all while following the classic 'walks into a bar' format with an absurdist escalation."
