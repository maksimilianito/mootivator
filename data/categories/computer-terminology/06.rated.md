- text: "I thought 'bandwidth' was a music group."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the confusion between technical terminology and everyday language. 'Bandwidth' in networking refers to data transfer capacity, but to a non-technical person, it sounds like it could be the name of a band. The humor comes from the innocent misunderstanding of tech jargon."

- text: "Why did the developer think 'cookies' were dessert? Because he was hungry for data!"
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'cookies' - both the edible treat and browser cookies that store data. The punchline creates an unexpected connection between the physical hunger and the technical concept of data storage."

- text: "My boss asked me to 'ping' him later. So I threw a small ball at his office door."
  explanation: "This exploits the incongruity between the technical meaning of 'ping' (sending a network test packet) and the literal interpretation of making a pinging sound. The absurdity of the physical action creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a computer's favorite snack? Microchips!"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke using the double meaning of 'chips' - both computer components and potato chips. The setup leads to an expected but satisfying pun that works on the similarity of the terms."
  rating: 4

- text: "I told my grandma I work in 'the cloud.' She asked if I needed an umbrella."
  explanation: "This highlights the confusion that abstract tech terminology creates for non-technical people. 'The cloud' as a metaphor for distributed computing sounds literal to someone unfamiliar with the concept, creating a humorous misunderstanding."

- text: "Why don't computers ever get lost? They always follow the right protocol!"
  explanation: "This plays on 'protocol' as both a networking term (rules for data transmission) and a general term for proper procedure. The joke suggests computers are never lost because they strictly follow their programming."
  rating: 5

- text: "My friend said he's learning 'Python.' I asked him if he's becoming a snake charmer."
  explanation: "Another case of technical terminology confusion, where the programming language Python is mistaken for the actual snake. The humor comes from the literal interpretation of a technical term."

- text: "What do you call a computer that sings? A-Dell!"
  explanation: "A pun combining the computer brand 'Dell' with the musical term 'Adele.' It's a simple play on words that creates an unexpected connection between technology and music."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked IT to explain 'phishing.' They said it's not about catching fish, but I still brought my rod."
  explanation: "This joke uses the homophone 'phishing' (cybersecurity threat) and 'fishing' (the sport) to create confusion. The absurdity of bringing a fishing rod to an IT security discussion amplifies the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus and needed to see a specialist - an anti-body!"
  explanation: "This combines medical terminology with computer terminology. 'Virus' works in both contexts, and 'anti-body' cleverly plays on 'antibody' and 'antivirus software,' creating a layered pun."
  rating: 7

- text: "My manager said we need more 'throughput.' I asked if we're starting a drive-through restaurant."
  explanation: "The joke plays on 'throughput' (a measure of system performance) being confused with 'drive-through put' or just the concept of things going through. The misdirection to a restaurant context creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation!"
  explanation: "This is meta-humor about software development culture. If something is documented, it's a feature; if not, it's a bug. It satirizes how developers sometimes justify problems by calling them features."
  rating: 8

- text: "I thought 'firmware' was clothing for tech companies. Turns out, computers don't wear pants."
  explanation: "The wordplay on 'firm' (as in business) and 'ware' (as in clothing like 'wear') creates a misunderstanding. The punchline's absurd image of computers wearing pants amplifies the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the programmer confuse 'cache' with 'cash'? Because both disappear when you need them most!"
  explanation: "This uses the homophone 'cache' (temporary storage) and 'cash' (money) to create a relatable comparison. The punchline works because both actually do tend to be insufficient when needed, adding truth to the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "My nephew asked what 'RAM' means. I said it's when a computer runs into problems. He asked if it needs a helmet."
  explanation: "This plays on RAM (Random Access Memory) being confused with the verb 'ram' (to crash into something). The child's logical follow-up question about a helmet adds an extra layer of innocent absurdity."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call someone who's afraid of acronyms? PTSD - Petrified of Technical Slang Disorder!"
  explanation: "This is recursive meta-humor that creates a fake acronym while making a joke about acronyms themselves. It plays on the overwhelming nature of tech jargon while demonstrating the very problem it describes."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my date I work with 'backend systems.' She hasn't called back. I think she misunderstood."
  explanation: "The humor comes from the potential misinterpretation of 'backend' in a non-technical context. The joke relies on the awkwardness created by technical terminology sounding inappropriate in social situations."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer bring a ladder to the meeting? The manager said we need to discuss 'higher-level architecture.'"
  explanation: "This takes the abstract concept of 'higher-level architecture' (system design abstraction) and interprets it literally as something physically high. The absurdity of bringing a ladder demonstrates the confusion tech jargon can create."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's the most confusing thing in IT? When 'deprecated' doesn't mean 'appreciated less' but 'don't use this anymore or we'll judge you harshly.'"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated humor about how technical terms don't match their linguistic roots. 'Deprecated' sounds mild but carries strong implications in programming, and the joke highlights this disconnect with social commentary."
  rating: 8

- text: "My therapist asked about my 'latency issues.' I said, 'Doc, I'm here on time! You mean my network latency issues?' Now I have two appointments."
  explanation: "This brilliant misdirection uses 'latency' in both psychological (being late) and technical (network delay) contexts. The punchline suggests the programmer missed the therapist's actual concern, creating ironic self-awareness about tech obsession."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do programmers confuse Halloween and Christmas? Because OCT 31 = DEC 25! But why do they confuse relationships and databases? Because they keep trying to establish connections, normalize everything, and can't handle NULL values when someone says 'I need space.'"
  explanation: "This starts with a classic octal/decimal joke (31 in octal equals 25 in decimal) then escalates into a complex metaphor comparing relationship behaviors to database operations. It works on multiple levels: technical accuracy, relationship humor, and the stereotype of programmers overthinking everything through technical frameworks. The 'NULL values' and 'I need space' double meaning (emotional space vs. database space) creates a sophisticated layered punchline."
