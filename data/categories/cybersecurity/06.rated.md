- text: I changed my password to "incorrect" so whenever I forget, my computer tells me "Your password is incorrect."
  explanation: This joke plays on the literal interpretation of error messages. The humor comes from the incongruity between the intended helpful error message and the user deliberately making it literally true, creating a paradoxical situation where forgetting becomes remembering.

- text: How many security experts does it take to change a lightbulb? They won't tell you - that information could be exploited.
  explanation: This parodies the excessive secrecy and "security through obscurity" mindset, applying it absurdly to mundane information. It highlights how security paranoia can become counterproductive.

- text: I'm not saying our security is bad, but our firewall is basically a "Please Don't Hack Us" sign.
  explanation: This uses understatement and comparison to highlight inadequate security measures. The humor comes from reducing sophisticated security infrastructure to a polite request.

- text: Why did the penetration tester fail the exam? They couldn't break into the testing room.
  explanation: This creates irony by showing a professional hacker unable to physically bypass a simple lock, contrasting digital prowess with physical limitations in a setup-punchline format.

- text: Our company's security policy is two-factor authentication - a password and hope.
  explanation: This joke subverts the technical term "two-factor authentication" by replacing the second legitimate factor with the abstract concept of hope, highlighting inadequate security through absurdist humor.

- text: I encrypted my hard drive so well that when I die, archaeologists will think I was hiding ancient secrets. I was just hiding my browser history.
  explanation: This joke uses exaggeration and anticlimax, building up the image of mysterious encrypted data only to reveal mundane embarrassing content. It plays on the disparity between security effort and actual content value.

- text: A cybersecurity expert's favorite pickup line - "Are you a firewall? Because I've been trying to get through to you all night, but you keep blocking my packets."
  explanation: This combines romantic comedy tropes with technical terminology, creating a nerdy pickup line that works on multiple levels. The personification of network security concepts adds to the awkward charm.
  rating: 6

- text: Our security is like an onion - it has many layers, and it makes hackers cry. Just kidding, they cry from laughing at how easy it was to peel.
  explanation: This joke sets up a positive security metaphor only to completely subvert it with self-deprecating reality. The double twist creates humor through expectation violation and honest admission of failure.

- text: Why did the hacker break up with their girlfriend? She kept asking for his password, and he realized she was a social engineering attack.
  explanation: This applies cybersecurity concepts to relationships, treating romantic manipulation as a technical threat. The humor comes from the paranoid perspective of viewing personal relationships through a security lens.
  rating: 7

- text: I practice security through obscurity. My code is so obscure, even I don't know how it works anymore.
  explanation: This joke criticizes the flawed "security through obscurity" approach while simultaneously describing bad programming practices. The self-deprecating admission that the programmer has lost control adds to the humor.
  rating: 8

- text: A hacker died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, "Your password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one number, one special character, and cannot be any password you've used in your previous life." The hacker is still at the gates.
  explanation: This joke combines religious imagery with password requirement frustration, creating an absurdist scenario where even the afterlife has impossible security requirements. The punchline suggests eternal damnation through password policy.

- text: Why do hackers make excellent philosophers? They've proven that nothing is secure, everything is permitted, and the only truth is that someone will eventually find the vulnerability in your argument - usually a 14-year-old in their basement.
  explanation: This sophisticated joke references the Assassin's Creed motto while commenting on cybersecurity reality, hacker culture, and the humbling fact that expertise doesn't protect against determined amateurs. It layers multiple concepts for complex humor that rewards technical knowledge.
