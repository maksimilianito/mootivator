- text: "Our standup meetings are so long, we should call them 'sit-downs.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that 'standup meetings' are supposed to be brief, but many teams experience the opposite. The suggestion to rename them 'sit-downs' highlights how they've become the exact opposite of their intended purpose."

- text: "Why do developers prefer working from home? Because 'localhost' is their favorite place."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'localhost' - both the technical term for a computer referring to itself (127.0.0.1) and the literal concept of one's local home being their preferred location. It plays on developer stereotypes about preferring isolation."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code review comments are so polite, they come with trigger warnings for constructive criticism."
  explanation: "This satirizes modern workplace culture around feedback and the sometimes overly cautious nature of communication in tech companies, where even helpful suggestions must be carefully worded to avoid offense."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not antisocial, I'm just in 'Do Not Disturb' mode permanently."
  explanation: "This applies a technical concept (the 'Do Not Disturb' status in messaging apps) to the programmer stereotype of preferring solitude and minimal social interaction, reframing antisocial behavior as a feature setting."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our 'quick sync' was so quick, I aged three years during it."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to mock corporate jargon, specifically the term 'quick sync' which rarely lives up to its name. The incongruity between 'quick' and 'aged three years' creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer bring a ladder to work? To reach the next level of abstraction."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'level' - both a physical height requiring a ladder and the programming concept of 'levels of abstraction.' It visualizes an abstract concept literally."
  rating: 7

- text: "My company's 'unlimited PTO' policy is like a gym membership - technically available but discouraged by guilt."
  explanation: "This exposes the reality behind a popular tech company benefit. The comparison to unused gym memberships highlights the gap between what's offered and what's actually utilized due to workplace culture."
  rating: 9

- text: "We don't have technical debt, we have 'legacy features with character.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes corporate euphemisms and the tendency to rebrand problems as features. It's a misdirection pattern where technical debt is reframed as something positive and intentional."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't programmers like nature? Too many bugs and not enough documentation."
  explanation: "This applies programming frustrations (bugs and missing documentation) to the natural world, creating humor through the literal interpretation of 'bugs' and the absurdity of expecting nature to have documentation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our sprint planning takes longer than the actual sprint."
  explanation: "This one-liner exposes a common agile methodology dysfunction through simple comparison. The incongruity of planning taking more time than doing highlights poor time management in many tech teams."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my manager I needed a rubber duck for debugging. Now I have a duck and a performance review about 'professional communication skills.'"
  explanation: "This references the rubber duck debugging technique while creating humor from a manager's misunderstanding of this legitimate practice, resulting in an absurd consequence."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to play hide and seek? Because good developers are always findable in Slack."
  explanation: "This plays on workplace culture expectations around availability and responsiveness, suggesting that being constantly findable has become so normalized that even games would be affected."
  rating: 6

- text: "My company celebrates 'Casual Friday' by letting us write code without comments."
  explanation: "This creates humor by applying the concept of casual dress codes to coding practices, suggesting that proper documentation is seen as 'formal' while uncommented code is 'casual' - a dangerous but relatable idea."
  rating: 8

- text: "We practice agile development: we're agile at adding meetings and sprinting away from documentation."
  explanation: "This satirizes how agile methodology is often implemented poorly, with companies adopting the ceremonies (meetings) while ignoring important practices (documentation). The wordplay on 'agile' and 'sprinting' adds another layer."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer quit the circus? Too many clowns in code review, and they weren't even funny."
  explanation: "This uses the circus metaphor to criticize unhelpful code reviewers who make jokes or nitpick without adding value. The setup creates expectations about actual circus work before pivoting to workplace dynamics."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our 'rockstar developer' plays the same three chords over and over. We call them copy, paste, and Stack Overflow."
  explanation: "This satirizes the 'rockstar developer' job posting clich√© while exposing common shortcuts developers take. The musical metaphor of 'three chords' cleverly maps to actual development practices."
  rating: 9

- text: "I practice work-life balance: I work during meetings and live during compile time."
  explanation: "This joke reveals the reality of multitasking in tech culture, where developers optimize their time by doing real work during unproductive meetings and taking breaks during unavoidable waiting periods."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't developers trust stairs? Because they prefer elevators - they're more abstract and someone else handles the implementation."
  explanation: "This extends the abstraction concept to physical architecture, playing on developers' preference for working at high levels of abstraction while letting others handle low-level details, even in non-programming contexts."
  rating: 7

- text: "My team's definition of 'minimum viable product' is whatever stops the product manager from crying."
  explanation: "This darkly humorous take on MVP culture reveals the emotional negotiation that often happens in product development, where technical definitions give way to managing stakeholder expectations and emotions."
  rating: 9

- text: "We hired a 'full-stack developer.' Turns out they're just really good at stacking full plates of technical debt across every layer of the application."
  explanation: "This plays brilliantly on the term 'full-stack' by literalizing 'stack' and 'full,' while exposing how the impressive-sounding title can mask someone who creates problems at every level rather than solving them."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the senior developer become a gardener? After 20 years of pruning git branches, they wanted to prune something that actually grows."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated joke that works on multiple levels: the parallel between git branch management and gardening, the existential burnout of maintenance work, and the ironic contrast between managing code that often deteriorates versus plants that actually grow and thrive."
