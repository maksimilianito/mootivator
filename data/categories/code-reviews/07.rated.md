  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity to highlight the sometimes misplaced priorities in code reviews, where reviewers focus on minor formatting issues rather than the actual algorithmic correctness or design decisions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the junior developer fear code reviews? Because every comment felt like a 'critical' error."
  explanation: "A play on the double meaning of 'critical' - both as severe/important and as criticism. It uses the setup-punchline structure to create humor from the emotional experience of receiving feedback."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code reviewer approved my PR with 'LGTM.' I later found out it meant 'Let's Get This Merged,' not 'Looks Good To Me.'"
  explanation: "This uses misdirection and the relief theory, playing on the common acronym 'LGTM' and suggesting a reviewer's eagerness to finish rather than thoroughness."

  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always write perfect code, but when I do, my reviewer finds a missing space before a closing bracket."
  explanation: "Playing on the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format, this uses incongruity between the expectation of finding real issues versus trivial formatting concerns."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do code reviewers make terrible poker players? They always show their 'comments' too early."
  explanation: "A wordplay joke using the double meaning of 'comments' - both code comments and verbal remarks, with the setup-punchline structure creating unexpected connection."

- text: "How many code reviewers does it take to approve a one-line change? Five: one to suggest a refactor, three to debate naming conventions, and one to finally approve it six days later."

- text: "Why did the developer's code review take three weeks? The reviewer was waiting for the perfect moment to say 'Have you considered using a different approach?'"
  explanation: "Misdirection humor that builds tension with the setup about delay, then delivers a punchline about unhelpful, vague feedback that could have been given immediately."
  rating: 7

- text: "My favorite code review comment: 'This is clever.' Which I've learned is developer-speak for 'I hate this and you should feel bad.'"
  explanation: "Meta-humor about developer culture and communication, using the incongruity between surface meaning and actual intent, revealing unspoken social codes."
  rating: 10

- text: "What's a code reviewer's favorite exercise? Nitpicking. It's great for the fingers but terrible for team morale."
  explanation: "Wordplay on 'exercise' combined with social commentary, using the double meaning of 'nitpicking' as both a physical action and critical behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "I wrote self-documenting code. My reviewer still asked for more comments. I added: '// This is self-documenting code.'"
  explanation: "Recursive humor and absurdity, highlighting the paradox of being asked to document self-evident code, with the meta-solution adding to the comedy."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't code reviewers ever approve Halloween decorations? Because they always find something 'scary' about the implementation."
  explanation: "Uses the double meaning of 'scary' (Halloween theme and bad code) with seasonal context, creating layered humor through wordplay and technical reference."
  rating: 5

- text: "Code review stages: 1) This is fine. 2) Minor changes needed. 3) Complete architectural overhaul suggested. 4) 'Actually, the original approach was good.' Welcome to development purgatory."
  explanation: "Storytelling format with escalating absurdity, using the relief theory to address the frustrating reality of changing requirements and opinions during review cycles."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code reviewer and I had a disagreement about variable naming. Three hours later, we realized we were both wrong. The variable wasn't even being used."
  explanation: "Narrative joke with an unexpected twist ending, using absurdity and self-deprecation to highlight how reviewers can miss the forest for the trees."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the code review become a philosophical debate? Because someone asked, 'But what IS clean code, really?' and nobody has recovered since."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about the subjective nature of code quality, using exaggeration and absurdity to mock how simple reviews can spiral into existential discussions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code review comment: 'Can you explain your reasoning here?' My reasoning: Stack Overflow said it would work. Their reasoning: probably also Stack Overflow. It's Stack Overflow all the way down."

  rating: 10

- text: "Senior developer's code review: 'Approved with 47 comments.' Junior developer's code review: 'Approved with 47 comments.' The difference? The senior's comments are all on their own code, written as a preemptive defense. The junior's are all questions about why they didn't just copy-paste from the senior's last PR."
  explanation: "Complex narrative structure with parallel comparison and unexpected reversal, using superiority theory and workplace dynamics to create humor from the different approaches to code reviews at various experience levels, with meta-commentary on code reuse and defensive programming practices."
