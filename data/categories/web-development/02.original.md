- text: "CSS is like a relationship: everything's fine until you add !important."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the CSS property '!important' which overrides normal styling rules, comparing it to how forcing things in relationships often causes problems. The humor comes from the double meaning of 'important' in both technical and relational contexts."

- text: "Why do web developers prefer dark mode? Because the light at the end of the tunnel is usually a 404 error."
  explanation: "This combines the popular developer preference for dark mode with the pessimistic reality of web development where things often go wrong, represented by the infamous 404 error. It subverts the optimistic idiom about 'light at the end of the tunnel.'"

- text: "HTML and CSS walked into a bar. They left because they couldn't get JavaScript to serve them."
  explanation: "This joke personifies the three main web technologies, playing on how HTML and CSS are static and need JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive functionality like 'serving' content."

- text: "My website is like my gym membership—I pay for it monthly but rarely work on it."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke compares the common experience of paying for unused gym memberships to the reality of maintaining personal websites, highlighting procrastination and good intentions that never materialize."

- text: "Why did the web developer go broke? Too many cache flow problems."
  explanation: "A pun combining 'cache' (stored web data) with 'cash flow' (financial term), creating humor through the homophone and applying technical terminology to a financial situation."

- text: "I told my therapist about my div alignment issues. She said I need better boundaries."
  explanation: "This joke cleverly conflates CSS div alignment problems with psychological boundaries, finding humor in applying therapy language to technical web development challenges."

- text: "A web developer walks into a bar, a restaurant, and a café. He was testing his location-based app."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic 'walks into a bar' joke setup by providing a logical, technical explanation for visiting multiple establishments—testing functionality rather than being the butt of a joke."

- text: "My code is perfectly responsive. It responds to every change by breaking completely."
  explanation: "This plays on the web development term 'responsive design' (adapting to different screen sizes) by reframing it as code that 'responds' by failing, using misdirection for humor."

- text: "Why don't web developers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including their CSS frameworks."
  explanation: "This adapts a classic science joke by adding a web development twist about CSS frameworks, which are indeed 'made up' by developers and constantly changing, creating layers of meaning."

- text: "I spent three hours debugging only to realize I forgot a semicolon. The computer knew. It was just testing my patience."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the computer as deliberately withholding information about a simple syntax error, reflecting the frustration of spending excessive time on trivial mistakes."

- text: "Web developers don't die. They just lose their domain."
  explanation: "A play on words using 'domain' (website address) instead of 'mind' in the phrase 'lose their mind,' creating a morbid but clever technical pun about digital existence."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer quit his job? He didn't get arrays."
  explanation: "A double pun on 'arrays' (data structure) and 'a raise' (salary increase), using homophone humor to connect technical concepts with workplace frustrations."

- text: "My website loads so slowly, users are experiencing my content in chronological order of when I wrote it."
  explanation: "This exaggerates slow loading times to an absurd degree, suggesting the delay is so long that the order of content creation becomes apparent, highlighting performance issues through hyperbole."

- text: "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it."
  explanation: "A pun on 'console.log()' (JavaScript debugging method) and the act of consoling/comforting someone, creating a simple but effective wordplay on technical terminology."

- text: "I'm not saying my website is slow, but I started loading it in 2019 and the progress bar just said 'See you next decade.'"
  explanation: "Extreme exaggeration of website loading times, personifying the progress bar with sarcastic commentary, using absurdity to highlight a common web development frustration."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks: 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This personifies a SQL JOIN operation (combining database tables) as a social interaction, cleverly using database terminology in a social context for layered humor."

- text: "My flex-box layout is like my life—everything's aligned until I add one more thing, then chaos ensues."
  explanation: "Compares CSS flexbox behavior (where adding elements can disrupt carefully arranged layouts) to life's fragile balance, using technical frustration as a metaphor for existential challenges."

- text: "Why did the front-end developer break up with the back-end developer? There was no connection. The API was down."
  explanation: "Uses API connectivity issues as a metaphor for relationship breakdown, with multiple layers—technical (API failure), emotional (lack of connection), and professional (front-end/back-end divide)."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Stay buggy, my friends."
  explanation: "Parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme while highlighting the dangerous but sometimes real practice of testing in production environments, ending with a self-aware twist on 'stay thirsty.'"

- text: "Web development is just Stack Overflow, coffee, and existential dread held together by semicolons and prayer."
  explanation: "This aphorism captures the entire web development experience by combining reliance on Stack Overflow, caffeine dependency, emotional stress, and the fragility of code syntax in one comprehensive statement."

- text: "I finally achieved work-life balance as a web developer: my code doesn't work, and my life has no balance."
  explanation: "A dark but clever inversion of 'work-life balance' that plays on the double meaning of 'work' (functioning code vs. employment) and 'balance' (life harmony vs. stability), creating layered ironic humor about developer struggles."
