- text: "Functional programmers don't have side effects. They have 'unintended features.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the core principle of functional programming (avoiding side effects) while using the classic programmer's defense of calling bugs 'features.' It's a simple wordplay that references a fundamental programming paradigm concept."

- text: "Why did the object-oriented programmer get stuck in the shower? The shampoo bottle said 'Lather, Rinse, Repeat' but didn't specify the exit condition."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic infinite loop setup with a mundane scenario. It subtly mocks OOP programmers by suggesting they follow instructions too literally, like objects following methods without built-in termination logic."
  rating: 8

- text: "Procedural programming: Do this, then do that. Object-oriented programming: Ask this thing to do that. Functional programming: Calculate what that would be if someone did it."
  explanation: "This joke uses parallel structure to highlight the philosophical differences between paradigms through increasingly abstract descriptions, ending with functional programming's emphasis on pure computation over action."
  rating: 7

- text: "An object-oriented programmer walked into a bar. He asked for a beer. The bartender said, 'Sorry, you need to inherit from Customer first.'"
  explanation: "This joke applies OOP inheritance rules to a real-world scenario, creating humor through the incongruity of requiring formal class relationships for everyday interactions."
  rating: 7

- text: "Functional programming is like describing how to make a sandwich. Imperative programming is making the sandwich. Object-oriented programming is hiring a SandwichMaker to make the sandwich."
  explanation: "This joke uses a relatable analogy to distinguish between paradigms, with the punchline being the over-engineered OOP solution that adds unnecessary abstraction to a simple task."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do functional programmers always carry extra clothes? Because they believe in immutability—they never change."
  explanation: "This joke creates a double meaning with 'never change,' referring both to immutable data structures in functional programming and the colloquial phrase about stubborn people, with an absurd practical consequence."
  rating: 7

- text: "A procedural programmer writes 'goto beach.' An OOP programmer creates a Beach class with a visit() method. A functional programmer maps over all possible beaches and returns the optimal one without ever leaving home."
  explanation: "This joke escalates the complexity of solutions across paradigms, ending with the functional programmer's solution being so abstract it defeats the purpose—a common criticism of over-engineering in FP."
  rating: 9

- text: "Object-oriented programming: Hiding your data behind methods. Functional programming: Hiding your methods behind data."
  explanation: "This is a concise aphorism that inverts the traditional OOP encapsulation concept to describe FP's approach, creating humor through the unexpected symmetry and philosophical reversal."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to explain functional programming to my cat. She just returned undefined and walked away."
  explanation: "This joke personifies a cat as a function that returns undefined (a programming concept), playing on cats' notorious indifference while making a technical reference to function return values."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the imperative programmer break up with the declarative programmer? One wanted to control exactly how things happened, the other just wanted to describe what they wanted and let someone else figure it out."
  explanation: "This joke uses a relationship metaphor to highlight the fundamental difference between imperative (how) and declarative (what) programming styles, suggesting incompatibility in both code and relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "A functional programmer doesn't change light bulbs. They return a new room with the bulb already changed."
  explanation: "This joke applies the functional programming principle of immutability to a classic 'light bulb' joke format, suggesting that rather than mutating state, you create entirely new state—an absurdly inefficient solution."
  rating: 9

- text: "Object-oriented programming is like a restaurant where every dish is served by a different specialized waiter who only knows about that one dish and refuses to acknowledge the others exist."
  explanation: "This joke critiques OOP's encapsulation and single responsibility principle by showing how it can lead to over-specialization and poor communication, using a relatable restaurant scenario."
  rating: 7

- text: "In procedural programming, you're the chef. In OOP, you manage a kitchen of chefs. In functional programming, you write the recipe and hope someone eventually cooks it."
  explanation: "This joke uses culinary metaphors to show the increasing abstraction and delegation across paradigms, with the functional programming punchline suggesting its solutions can be too theoretical."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do functional programmers love hiking? Because they appreciate pure functions: no matter how many times you climb the same mountain, you always get the same view at the top."
  explanation: "This joke connects the mathematical concept of pure functions (same input always produces same output) with a peaceful outdoor activity, creating an unexpectedly wholesome comparison."
  rating: 6

- text: "An object sent a message to another object. The second object replied, 'Sorry, that method is private.' The first object said, 'But we're friends!' The second object said, 'Not in my class declaration.'"
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes objects to create a social drama around access modifiers in OOP, where friendship in code is strictly defined by formal declarations, unlike human relationships."
  rating: 8

- text: "Reactive programming: 'Don't call us, we'll call you.' Proactive programming: 'We'll call you before you even know you need us.' Retroactive programming: 'We should have called you yesterday.'"
  explanation: "This joke starts with the genuine observer pattern description for reactive programming, then invents increasingly absurd paradigms, with the final one suggesting programming that operates backwards in time."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the aspect-oriented programmer get fired? Every time someone tried to do anything, he'd interrupt with 'Before you do that, let me just log this real quick.'"
  explanation: "This joke takes AOP's cross-cutting concerns (like logging) and applies them to human behavior, showing how aspects that intercept method calls would be incredibly annoying in real social interactions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A logic programmer walks into a bar. The bartender asks, 'Do you want a drink?' The programmer responds, 'Yes.' Nothing happens. The bartender asks, 'What drink?' The programmer says, 'Yes.'"
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly captures logic programming's literal interpretation of queries, where 'yes' answers whether a solution exists but doesn't bind variables—a common source of confusion for beginners."
  rating: 10

- text: "Concurrent programming is like conducting an orchestra where every musician is playing a different piece, in a different key, at a different tempo, and you're just hoping they accidentally sync up at some point."
  explanation: "This joke uses musical chaos to describe the difficulty of concurrent programming, where coordinating multiple simultaneous processes often feels more like hoping for luck than engineering a solution."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the metaprogrammer bring a mirror to the code review? Because they wanted to review code that reviews code that reviews code, and at some point, you need to reflect on what you're doing with your life."
  explanation: "This joke starts with the technical concept of metaprogramming and reflection, then pivots to existential philosophy, suggesting that writing code that writes code might be taking abstraction too far."
  rating: 9

- text: "Event-driven programming is explaining to your spouse that you can't predict when you'll be home because you're waiting for events to fire. They say, 'That's just being reactive.' You say, 'Exactly! You understand event-driven architecture!' They say, 'I want a divorce.' You register a callback for that."
  explanation: "This joke creates a complete narrative arc where programming paradigms destroy a marriage, with the programmer remaining oblivious and treating even the divorce as just another event to handle—showing how programmers sometimes apply technical thinking inappropriately to life."
