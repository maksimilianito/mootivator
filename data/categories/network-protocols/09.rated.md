- text: "HTTP is like a polite conversation where everyone forgets what was said immediately after."
  explanation: "This joke plays on HTTP's stateless nature - each request is independent and the protocol doesn't retain information between requests, similar to someone with severe short-term memory loss."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did TCP break up with UDP? Too many commitment issues."
  explanation: "TCP requires a connection handshake and guarantees delivery (commitment), while UDP is connectionless and doesn't guarantee delivery (no commitment). This applies relationship terminology to protocol behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "UDP walks into a bar. The bartender doesn't acknowledge him."
  explanation: "UDP is a connectionless protocol that doesn't wait for acknowledgment of received packets, unlike TCP. The joke uses the classic 'walks into a bar' format to illustrate this technical difference."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my friend a UDP joke, but I'm not sure he got it."
  explanation: "UDP doesn't guarantee packet delivery or provide confirmation of receipt, so you never know if your data actually arrived - just like telling a joke and getting no response."
  rating: 10

- text: "TCP is that friend who texts 'Did you get my message?' after every single message."
  explanation: "TCP uses acknowledgment packets (ACKs) to confirm every segment was received, making it seem overly anxious about message delivery, like an insecure friend constantly seeking confirmation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't network protocols ever win arguments? They keep getting interrupted by timeouts."
  explanation: "Network protocols have timeout mechanisms where if a response isn't received within a certain time, the connection or request is terminated, similar to someone giving up on an argument mid-conversation."
  rating: 6

- text: "ICMP is the network's passive-aggressive way of saying 'Destination Unreachable' instead of just being honest."
  explanation: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) sends error messages like 'Destination Unreachable' which sounds like passive-aggressive communication rather than direct problem-solving."
  rating: 7

- text: "HTTP GET requests are like asking questions you already know the answer to - you just want to hear it again."
  explanation: "GET requests retrieve data from servers, often the same data repeatedly. The joke compares this to people who ask questions not for information but for confirmation or repetition."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the packet go to therapy? It had severe fragmentation issues."
  explanation: "IP fragmentation occurs when packets are broken into smaller pieces to fit through networks. The joke uses 'fragmentation' as a psychological term for feeling broken or incomplete."
  rating: 8

- text: "A TCP packet walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll it be?' The packet says, 'I'll have a SYN.' The bartender replies 'SYN-ACK.' The packet says 'ACK,' and then they finally start drinking."
  explanation: "This is a detailed play on the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) required to establish a connection before any data transfer. The joke shows how much ceremony is required before anything actually happens."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do network engineers prefer IPv6 parties? More addresses means everyone gets invited."
  explanation: "IPv6 has a vastly larger address space than IPv4 (128-bit vs 32-bit), solving the address exhaustion problem. The joke compares this to having enough room for everyone at a party."
  rating: 7

- text: "DNS is basically the internet's phone book, if phone books took 50ms to flip to the right page and sometimes just said 'I don't know.'"
  explanation: "DNS translates domain names to IP addresses, but involves lookup time (latency) and can fail with NXDOMAIN responses, unlike the reliability of a physical phone book."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the HTTP request feel insecure? Because it wasn't using HTTPS."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'insecure' meaning both emotionally uncertain and technically unencrypted. HTTPS adds SSL/TLS encryption to secure HTTP traffic."
  rating: 6

- text: "ARP broadcasts are like someone walking into a crowded room and yelling 'WHO HAS THIS IP ADDRESS?' until somebody responds."
  explanation: "Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) broadcasts requests to all devices on a network to find which MAC address corresponds to an IP address, which is indeed like shouting to a crowd."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't routers ever gossip? Because they only forward what they're told to forward."
  explanation: "Routers forward packets based on routing tables and rules, not content. This contrasts with how humans might spread information, adding their own interpretation or passing along things they shouldn't."
  rating: 5

- text: "DHCP is the network equivalent of a hotel concierge who assigns you a room number, tells you where everything is, then says 'You have to leave by checkout time.'"
  explanation: "DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses with lease times, providing network configuration information temporarily, exactly like a hotel room assignment with a checkout deadline."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the FTP connection feel old-fashioned? It kept sending its username and password in plain text at fancy restaurants."
  explanation: "FTP transmits credentials unencrypted, which is insecure and outdated. The joke compares this to being socially inappropriate, like discussing private information in public."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SYN packet, a SYN-ACK packet, and an ACK packet walk into a bar. The bartender says, 'What is this, some kind of handshake?'"
  explanation: "This meta-joke directly calls out the TCP three-way handshake by name while using the classic bar joke format. The bartender's awareness makes it self-referential humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the network administrator refuse to use Telnet? Because he didn't want his passwords traveling naked across the internet."
  explanation: "Telnet sends all data including passwords unencrypted ('naked'), making it a security nightmare. The anthropomorphization of passwords as being embarrassed adds humor to the serious security concern."
  rating: 8

- text: "BGP is two routers meeting at a party and spending four hours explaining their entire life story and everyone they know before deciding if they want to be friends."
  explanation: "Border Gateway Protocol involves routers exchanging extensive routing information and policy details before establishing peering relationships, which is indeed like an exhaustingly thorough getting-to-know-you conversation."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do packets love traveling through the internet? Because every router they meet says 'You're one hop closer to your destination!' It's very motivational."
  explanation: "This joke personifies packet routing as a journey with encouraging checkpoints. Each router decrements the TTL (Time To Live) and forwards the packet, like a motivational coach helping you reach your goal one step at a time."
