```yaml
- text: "Our sprint planning meeting is scheduled for two hours. We're now on hour three discussing whether to use tabs or spaces."
  explanation: "This joke highlights how software teams often get sidetracked by trivial debates during planning meetings, spending more time than allocated on minor formatting preferences instead of actual feature planning."

- text: "Why did the developer's estimate change from 2 days to 2 weeks? He started reading the requirements."
  explanation: "This plays on the common experience where initial estimates are overly optimistic until developers actually understand the full scope of work, revealing the gap between perceived and actual complexity."

- text: "Our definition of 'done' has seventeen criteria. Shipping to production isn't one of them."
  explanation: "This satirizes how teams can create elaborate completion checklists that paradoxically don't include the most important milestone—actually delivering the software to users."

- text: "The code review has 47 comments. 46 are about naming conventions."
  explanation: "This highlights how code reviews can sometimes focus disproportionately on style and naming rather than logic, architecture, or potential bugs."

- text: "We practice continuous integration. The build has been continuously broken for three days."
  explanation: "A wordplay on 'continuous integration' methodology, suggesting that the only thing continuous is the failure state rather than successful integration of code."

- text: "Why don't waterfall developers look up? Because they can't go backwards!"
  explanation: "This references the waterfall methodology's linear, sequential approach where returning to previous phases is discouraged, contrasted with looking up which requires reversing direction."

- text: "Our standup meeting is now in its 45th minute. Three people are still standing, but only out of spite."
  explanation: "This mocks how 'standup' meetings, meant to be brief 15-minute syncs, often drag on so long that the physical discomfort becomes the only thing keeping people engaged."

- text: "I love pair programming! Said no one who's been the keyboard for two hours while their pair 'navigates' by checking email."
  explanation: "This exposes the dysfunction in pair programming when one person dominates by not actually participating, turning collaboration into observation."

- text: "The retrospective action items from last sprint: 'Improve communication.' Status: We didn't communicate about it."
  explanation: "A recursive joke about how teams often fail to act on the very improvements they identify, particularly when the improvement is about improving the improvement process itself."

- text: "Our velocity is increasing! We've started counting bugs as features."
  explanation: "This satirizes how teams might game agile metrics by redefining failures as successes, making their productivity appear better without actual improvement."

- text: "Why did the Scrum Master bring a ladder to the retrospective? To help the team reach their stretch goals they set three sprints ago and never mentioned again!"
  explanation: "This combines the physical metaphor of unreachable heights with the common pattern of setting ambitious goals that are quickly forgotten in the day-to-day grind."

- text: "We're adopting agile! First step: a six-month planning phase to determine how to be flexible."
  explanation: "The irony here is using rigid, lengthy planning—the antithesis of agile principles—to implement a methodology designed for adaptability and quick iteration."

- text: "The ticket says 'simple UI change.' The dependency graph looks like a subway map for a city that doesn't exist."
  explanation: "This illustrates the gap between how simple a task appears to non-technical stakeholders versus the complex web of interconnected systems developers must navigate."

- text: "Our code coverage is 95%! The other 5% is where all the actual business logic lives."
  explanation: "This jokes about how high test coverage metrics can be misleading when teams test trivial code but skip the complex, critical parts that actually need testing."

- text: "Why do developers hate changing requirements? Because their code is already perfect for the requirements from two weeks ago!"
  explanation: "This plays on developers' frustration with scope changes while also poking fun at the attachment to code that's already been written, even when it's no longer relevant."

- text: "We follow TDD religiously: Trauma-Driven Development. Every feature is built in response to a production incident."
  explanation: "A clever wordplay on Test-Driven Development, suggesting a reactive rather than proactive approach where development is motivated by past disasters rather than planned testing."

- text: "The project manager asked for an MVP. Three months later, we delivered an MLP: Minimum Lovable Product that nobody asked for but everyone spent time polishing."
  explanation: "This satirizes scope creep and perfectionism, where teams lose sight of 'minimum viable' and over-engineer features, changing the goal from validation to perfection."

- text: "Our deployment process has five environments: Dev, Test, Staging, Pre-prod, and 'Oh God What Happened in Production.'"
  explanation: "This jokes about how despite multiple testing environments, bugs still make it to production, necessitating an unofficial emergency environment for firefighting."

- text: "Why did the kanban board file for divorce? Too many blockers in the relationship and nothing ever moved to 'Done.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the kanban workflow to mirror relationship problems, where blocked tasks represent unresolved issues and lack of progress symbolizes stagnation."

- text: "We've achieved true DevOps: the developers operate the pagers, and operations develops a deep resentment."
  explanation: "A dark but realistic take on DevOps implementation, where instead of collaboration and shared responsibility, it becomes about shifting unpleasant duties and creating interdepartmental tension."

- text: "The architect spent six months designing a microservices system so elegant, so distributed, so perfectly decoupled that now nobody knows which service is actually processing the user's checkout. Including the checkout service."
  explanation: "This is the ultimate satire of over-engineering, where the pursuit of architectural purity creates a system so complex that it defeats its own purpose, with services so decoupled they've lost their connection to the actual business problem they're solving."
