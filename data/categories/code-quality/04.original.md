```yaml
- text: "My code passes all tests. I'm worried I didn't write enough tests."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the programmer's paranoia about code quality - when everything works too smoothly, experienced developers suspect they haven't tested thoroughly enough rather than celebrating success. It's a reversal of expected emotions."

- text: "Why did the developer name all their variables 'data'? They believed in minimalism."
  explanation: "This mocks poor naming conventions by pretending terrible variable naming is an intentional design philosophy, using the incongruity between 'minimalism' as a virtue and bad coding practices."

- text: "I refactored my code. Now it's broken in ways I don't understand instead of ways I did."
  explanation: "This captures the frustration when improving code quality backfires - the humor comes from the idea that familiar bugs are somehow better than mysterious new ones, subverting the expectation that refactoring always improves things."

- text: "What's the difference between legacy code and technical debt? Legacy code has already declared bankruptcy."
  explanation: "This extends the financial metaphor of 'technical debt' to its logical extreme, suggesting legacy code is beyond salvaging. The humor lies in treating code quality as a failed financial institution."

- text: "My code review comment was 'This is clever.' The developer asked if they should rewrite it."
  explanation: "In programming culture, 'clever' code is often a red flag for unmaintainable complexity. The joke plays on how 'clever' sounds like praise but is actually criticism, and the developer knows it."

- text: "I write self-documenting code. Unfortunately, it documents that I don't know what I'm doing."
  explanation: "This subverts the ideal of 'self-documenting code' (code so clear it needs no comments) by suggesting the code clearly reveals the programmer's incompetence instead of their intent."

- text: "Why don't senior developers write comments? Their code is a warning to others all by itself."
  explanation: "This plays with the expectation that senior developers write better code - instead suggesting their code is so bad it serves as a cautionary example, making comments redundant."

- text: "I follow the DRY principle religiously. Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't Repeat Yourself."
  explanation: "The joke violates the very principle it claims to follow (Don't Repeat Yourself), creating immediate ironic contradiction. The repetition demonstrates the opposite of what's being preached."

- text: "What's the best way to ensure code maintainability? Make sure you're never the one who has to maintain it."
  explanation: "This cynical joke suggests the only winning move is avoiding responsibility entirely, playing on the superiority theory - humor from acknowledging a selfish but relatable impulse."

- text: "My manager praised my code quality. I immediately started looking for a new job."
  explanation: "This implies that if management understands and approves your code, it must be too simple or you're not being challenged enough. It's a humble-brag disguised as concern."

- text: "I believe in the KISS principle: Keep It Spaghetti, Stupid."
  explanation: "This corrupts the famous 'Keep It Simple, Stupid' principle by replacing 'Simple' with 'Spaghetti' (a term for tangled, messy code), creating an anti-pattern version of good advice."

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to fix the bug? It had been there so long it was now a feature everyone depended on."
  explanation: "This plays on the classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' excuse, but adds the twist that the bug has become so entrenched that fixing it would break everything - a real phenomenon in legacy systems."

- text: "I practice extreme programming. Extremely bad programming."
  explanation: "This takes the methodology name 'Extreme Programming' and reinterprets it literally, suggesting intensity in the wrong direction. Simple wordplay with self-deprecating humor."

- text: "What do you call code without tests? A job security strategy."
  explanation: "This darkly suggests that writing unmaintainable, untested code ensures only you can work with it, making you indispensable. It's cynical commentary on perverse incentives."

- text: "My code has high cohesion and low coupling. High cohesion with bugs, low coupling with functionality."
  explanation: "This corrupts proper software design principles (high cohesion and low coupling are good) by applying them to the wrong things - bugs instead of features, creating absurd technical accuracy."

- text: "I wrote clean code once. Then I had to add a feature."
  explanation: "This captures the reality that requirements changes inevitably compromise initial elegant design. The brevity and resignation make it relatable to anyone who's maintained software."

- text: "Why do programmers prefer code reviews over therapy? At least in code reviews, people tell you exactly what's wrong with you."
  explanation: "This compares code criticism to psychological therapy, suggesting programmers prefer brutal honesty about their code over exploring emotional issues - a commentary on technical culture."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while admitting to the cardinal sin of testing in production, creating humor through brazen confession of bad practices."

- text: "What's the difference between good code and great code? Great code is good code that nobody's had to modify yet."
  explanation: "This philosophical joke suggests all code quality is temporary and only survives until someone needs to change it - a cynical but experienced perspective on software maintenance."

- text: "I asked my junior developer to write clean code. They deleted everything."
  explanation: "This plays on the ultimate interpretation of 'clean' - completely empty. The absurdist logic of the junior developer taking instructions to their most literal extreme creates the humor."

- text: "My code is like a good wine. It's gotten worse with age and gives everyone who touches it a headache."
  explanation: "This inverts the 'ages like fine wine' compliment, suggesting code deteriorates rather than improves over time, with the bonus punchline about headaches affecting both wine and bad code maintainers."
