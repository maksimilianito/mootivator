- text: "I entered a coding competition. Came in first place at starting the problem."
  explanation: "This joke uses self-deprecating humor about the common experience of beginning a challenge enthusiastically but not finishing it. The incongruity lies in treating 'starting' as if it were an achievement category in itself."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer fail the coding challenge? He spent 3 hours optimizing his Hello World solution."
  explanation: "This plays on the tendency of programmers to over-engineer simple solutions, especially under pressure. The incongruity is between the trivial nature of Hello World and the excessive time spent on it during a timed competition."
  rating: 8

- text: "Coding competitions: where you debug for 2 hours only to realize you read the problem wrong."
  explanation: "This reflects the common frustration of misunderstanding requirements. The humor comes from the wasted effort and the relatability of this experience to anyone who's competed."
  rating: 7

- text: "My solution passed all test cases except the ones that mattered."
  explanation: "This jokes about the difference between sample test cases and hidden edge cases in competitions. The incongruity is in the meaninglessness of partial success."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a competitive programmer's favorite exercise? Jumping to conclusions about time complexity."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'jumping' as both physical exercise and a logical fallacy, while referencing the crucial skill of analyzing algorithmic complexity in competitions."
  rating: 9

- text: "I'm great at algorithmic problems. I can solve a Fibonacci sequence in O(2^n) time every single time."
  explanation: "This is self-deprecating humor about implementing the worst possible solution (naive recursion) to a classic problem. The joke is in proudly stating consistency at being inefficient."
  rating: 8

- text: "In coding competitions, there are two types of people: those who can solve problems in 10 minutes, and liars."
  explanation: "This adapts the classic 'two types of people' format to mock the seemingly superhuman speed of top competitors, suggesting it's too good to be true."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do competitive programmers make terrible comedians? Their jokes only work for specific edge cases."
  explanation: "This plays on the competition mindset of handling edge cases, applying programming logic to humor. The incongruity is treating joke-telling like algorithm design."
  rating: 7

- text: "My ranking went up today! Turns out everyone better than me quit programming."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about relative ranking systems. The joke is that improvement came not from skill but from others leaving, highlighting the competitive nature of leaderboards."
  rating: 7

- text: "I solved a dynamic programming problem! Then I woke up."
  explanation: "This references the notorious difficulty of DP problems, treating solving one as literally a dream. The brevity and dream format add to the comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a coding puzzle and a jigsaw puzzle? With a jigsaw, you can see the picture on the box. With coding, the box is on fire and the picture keeps changing."
  explanation: "This uses extended metaphor to describe the chaotic nature of debugging competition problems under time pressure, with escalating absurdity (fire, changing requirements)."
  rating: 9

- text: "Competitive programming is easy: just think like a computer, type like a pianist, and debug like a detective with 10 minutes left."
  explanation: "This lists three impossible standards while pretending they're simple, using the word 'easy' ironically. The time pressure adds urgency to the absurdity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer bring a ladder to the coding competition? He heard the problems had multiple levels."
  explanation: "This uses literal interpretation of 'levels' (difficulty tiers) as physical levels requiring a ladder. The absurdity of bringing physical tools to solve logical problems creates the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "I finally understand recursion! I finally understand recursion! I finally understand recursion! Help, I'm stuck in a loop."
  explanation: "This demonstrates recursion by repeating itself, then reveals the speaker is trapped in the very concept they claim to understand. It's meta-humor about a fundamental programming concept."
  rating: 9

- text: "Coding competition strategy: Step 1: Read all problems. Step 2: Panic. Step 3: Solve the easiest one. Step 4: Realize there was no easy one. Step 5: More panic."
  explanation: "This presents a step-by-step guide that devolves into emotional responses rather than actual strategy, reflecting the real experience of overwhelming competition pressure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do algorithmic problems make terrible friends? They're always testing you, they never tell you what they really want, and when you finally understand them, time's up."
  explanation: "This personifies competition problems as bad friends, listing frustrations that parallel both relationships and coding challenges. The multi-layered comparison creates sophisticated humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code failed 47 test cases. But it passed test case #1, and isn't that what really matters? My therapist says no."
  explanation: "This uses absurd optimism about catastrophic failure, then undercuts it with a therapist reference, suggesting the speaker needs professional help for their delusion. The escalation creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a programmer who solves a NP-complete problem in polynomial time during a competition? A liar, or someone who didn't read the constraints."
  explanation: "This references deep computer science theory (P vs NP) and the reality that seeming miracles in competitions usually mean you misunderstood something. It requires technical knowledge to fully appreciate."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a binary search. It returned maybe."
  explanation: "This is minimalist humor where a binary algorithm (which should return definitive yes/no answers) returns an indecisive response. The absurdity is in the contradiction between binary logic and uncertain output."
  rating: 9

- text: "Competitive programming taught me that there are 10 types of people: those who understand binary, those who don't, and those who didn't expect a ternary joke."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated twist on the classic binary joke, adding a third category which itself makes the joke ternary rather than binary. It's meta-humor that subverts expectations while demonstrating the concept."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the programmer quit competitive coding? He couldn't handle the complexity. His therapist said it was O(n) going concern."
  explanation: "This is a multi-layered pun combining 'ongoing concern' (a therapy/business term) with Big O notation, while also referencing algorithmic complexity. The wordplay works on technical and linguistic levels simultaneously, making it the most sophisticated joke in the set."
