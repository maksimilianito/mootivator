- text: "My code is self-documenting. That's why nobody understands it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common developer excuse that code is 'self-documenting' (meaning the code itself explains what it does without comments), but twists it to reveal that the code is actually just poorly written and confusing. The incongruity lies in using a positive term to describe a negative outcome."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer's clean code look dirty? Because it had too many comments explaining why it was clean."
  explanation: "This uses the paradox pattern where over-documenting clean code defeats its purpose. Clean code should be self-explanatory, so excessive comments suggesting it's clean actually indicate it might not be. The humor comes from the contradiction between claiming cleanliness and needing to prove it."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A play on the famous 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, this joke highlights the terrible practice of testing in production environments. The superiority theory applies here as we laugh at the absurdity of this anti-pattern while recognizing many have been guilty of it."
  rating: 9

- text: "Refactoring: Making your code worse in new and exciting ways."
  explanation: "This subverts the expected definition of refactoring (improving code structure without changing functionality) by suggesting it actually makes things worse. The incongruity between the intention of refactoring and this outcome creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between good code and bad code? About six months."
  explanation: "This joke captures the temporal nature of code quality - what seems like good code today often looks terrible after time passes and requirements change. The setup suggests a fundamental difference, but the punchline reveals it's just a matter of perspective and time."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote clean code once. Then the requirements changed."
  explanation: "A simple two-sentence story that reflects the real frustration of software development. The joke uses relief theory, acknowledging the universal experience of having carefully crafted code destroyed by changing requirements."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers hate code reviews? Because their code is like their baby, and nobody wants to hear their baby is ugly."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor to explain the emotional attachment developers have to their code. The comparison to a baby creates humor through the absurdity while accurately capturing the defensive feelings many developers experience during reviews."
  rating: 7

- text: "Technical debt: When your code takes out a loan you can't afford and your future self has to pay it back with interest."
  explanation: "This extends the financial metaphor of technical debt to its logical conclusion, creating humor through the personification of code and the relatable concept of being trapped by past decisions. The 'future self' element adds a time-travel dimension to the joke."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code passes all the tests. Unfortunately, I wrote the tests to pass my code."
  explanation: "This joke exposes the circular logic flaw in test-driven development when done incorrectly. The misdirection pattern works here - first suggesting quality (passes tests), then revealing the tests are meaningless. It's a commentary on confirmation bias in testing."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call code that works but nobody knows why? Legacy. What do you call code that doesn't work and nobody knows why? Also legacy."
  explanation: "This joke uses parallel structure to show that 'legacy code' is defined more by its mysteriousness than its functionality. The double meaning pattern highlights how the term 'legacy' has become synonymous with 'incomprehensible' regardless of whether it works."
  rating: 10

- text: "I'm not saying my code is messy, but I just found a TODO comment from 2019 that says 'Clean this up before anyone sees it.'"
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke uses the discovery of an old comment as evidence of long-standing code quality issues. The specific date adds authenticity and the irony that the warning itself has become part of the mess creates layered humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer quit his job? His code was so clean, they thought he wasn't working."
  explanation: "This paradox joke subverts expectations - usually clean code is praised, but here it's so elegant it appears effortless, leading to misunderstanding. It's a commentary on how visible struggle is sometimes valued over actual quality in workplace environments."
  rating: 7

- text: "Code review feedback: 'This is beautiful.' Translation: 'I have no idea what this does, but I'm afraid to admit it.'"
  explanation: "This joke exposes the social dynamics of code reviews where reviewers may be reluctant to admit confusion. The translation format creates humor by revealing the hidden subtext beneath polite professional communication."
  rating: 9

- text: "My codebase has three states: broken, working, and 'I'm afraid to touch it because it might break.'"
  explanation: "This extends the typical binary of broken/working to include a third, very real state that developers experience. The humor comes from acknowledging that working code can be too fragile to maintain, which contradicts the ideal of robust software."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the best way to write maintainable code? Let someone else maintain it."
  explanation: "This cynical one-liner uses the superiority theory by suggesting the best solution to maintainability is avoidance. It plays on the common developer desire to work on new projects rather than maintain old ones, creating humor through relatable shirking of responsibility."
  rating: 7

- text: "I believe in the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself. I believe in the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself."
  explanation: "This meta-joke demonstrates the violation of DRY (a key principle of clean code) in its own structure by literally repeating itself. The self-referential humor works on multiple levels, as the joke commits the sin it's describing."
  rating: 10

- text: "A senior developer looks at code and says 'This could be simplified.' A junior developer looks at the same code and says 'I have no idea what this does.' They're both looking at the same function."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the subjective nature of code complexity and how experience changes perception. What appears simple to experts is mysterious to novices, creating humor through the contradiction of simultaneous simplicity and complexity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers prefer 'It works' over 'It's clean'? Because one is a state and the other is a journey, and nobody has time for journeys."
  explanation: "This philosophical joke contrasts the binary state of functionality with the continuous process of maintaining quality. The punchline about time pressure reflects the real-world prioritization that leads to technical debt, using relief theory to acknowledge shared frustrations."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my colleague to review my code for quality. He said 'It compiles.' I said 'That's not what I meant.' He said 'That's all I've got.'"
  explanation: "This dialogue-format joke shows how low the bar can fall in software development. The escalating disappointment from 'quality' to merely 'compiles' creates humor through the massive gap between expectations and reality, while remaining relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "The four stages of code quality: 1) It works! 2) It works? 3) How does this work? 4) It works (don't touch it)."
  explanation: "This progressive joke traces the lifecycle of code from confident creation through increasing mystery to fearful preservation. The punctuation changes (exclamation to question mark to parenthetical warning) enhance the narrative arc of declining understanding and increasing anxiety."
  rating: 10

- text: "Clean code is like a joke - if you have to explain it, it's not that good. Ironically, my code needs both comments and a therapist to explain itself."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses the classic 'explaining a joke' comparison to discuss code clarity, then subverts it by admitting the speaker's code is so bad it needs professional help. The escalation from comments to therapy creates absurdist humor while making a serious point about code quality."
