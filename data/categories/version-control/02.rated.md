- text: "I tried to commit my changes, but Git said I had a 'detached HEAD'. Now I'm worried about my health."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'detached HEAD' - a common Git state that sounds alarmingly medical to newcomers, creating humor through the incongruity between technical terminology and physical health concerns."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer always use Git? Because SVN was too 'sub-versive' for his taste."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay on 'subversion' (SVN's full name) and the word 'subversive', creating a pun that works on both technical and linguistic levels."
  rating: 4

- text: "My code works perfectly. I'm just not going to commit it in case Git disagrees."
  explanation: "This joke reflects the common programmer anxiety about committing code and the superstitious belief that version control somehow judges code quality, using relief theory to address developer stress."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite magic trick? Making merge conflicts disappear... by deleting the entire branch."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure to create humor through the 'solution' being worse than the problem - a nuclear option that technically works but defeats the purpose of version control."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Wait, that's what version control is for, right?"
  explanation: "This joke combines the famous 'Most Interesting Man' meme format with the dangerous practice of testing in production, sarcastically misunderstanding the purpose of version control as a safety net for recklessness."
  rating: 7

- text: "Version control is like a time machine, except instead of preventing disasters, you get to watch them happen in slow motion across multiple commits."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity between the idealized purpose of version control (safety and history) and the reality of watching mistakes unfold commit by commit, creating humor through disappointment."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to use branches? He was afraid of commitment."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke playing on both Git's 'commit' command and the psychological fear of commitment, using wordplay to connect technical and personal concepts."
  rating: 5

- text: "My Git history is like my browser history - full of things I'd rather no one ever saw."
  explanation: "This creates humor through comparison, using the universally relatable concept of embarrassing browser history to describe poorly documented or experimental Git commits."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a version control system that never works? A 'revision' of your career plans."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'revision' (both version control terminology and the concept of changing plans) while employing superiority theory through self-deprecating career humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "I finally understand Git rebase. It's like explaining to your past self why their decisions were terrible."
  explanation: "This uses the misdirection pattern by comparing a technical operation to the universal experience of hindsight regret, making the complex concept of rebasing relatable through emotional connection."
  rating: 9

- text: "Merge conflict resolution: where 'accepting both changes' means accepting that you'll be debugging for the next three hours."
  explanation: "This joke subverts expectations about the seemingly helpful 'accept both changes' option, revealing through experience that it often creates more problems than it solves."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do Git users make terrible historians? Because they keep rewriting history with 'git rebase'."
  explanation: "This creates humor by applying version control concepts to academic standards, highlighting the controversial practice of rewriting commit history through an incongruous comparison."
  rating: 6

- text: "I named my branch 'temporary-fix-delete-later'. That was three years ago. It's now in production."
  explanation: "This story-format joke uses the universal programmer experience of temporary solutions becoming permanent, reflecting the gap between intentions and reality in software development."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a Git merge and a family reunion? At least with Git, you can choose which conflicts to ignore."
  explanation: "This joke uses comparative humor to create an unexpected parallel between technical merge conflicts and interpersonal family drama, working on multiple levels of relatability."
  rating: 8

- text: "My commit messages are like my New Year's resolutions: overly ambitious at first, then just 'fixed stuff' by February."
  explanation: "This employs the pattern of declining quality over time, comparing the deterioration of commit message quality to the universal experience of abandoned resolutions."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer break up with SVN? Because Git told them they deserved someone who understood their need for branches and wouldn't lock them down."
  explanation: "This personifies version control systems as romantic partners, using relationship dynamics to highlight the technical differences between centralized and distributed version control."
  rating: 6

- text: "I asked Git to show me my mistakes. It said 'git log --all'. I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of honesty."
  explanation: "This uses meta-humor about self-reflection, treating Git as a brutally honest therapist who forces you to confront your entire coding history at once."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a developer's favorite bedtime story? 'The Little Commit That Could... Eventually Pass CI/CD After 47 Attempts'."
  explanation: "This parodies the classic children's story while highlighting the modern reality of continuous integration, creating layered humor through the absurdly specific number and the contrast between optimism and reality."
  rating: 8

- text: "My Git workflow: commit, push, break production, revert, blame the intern, create a branch called 'this-time-for-real', repeat."
  explanation: "This joke uses the absurdity technique to create an exaggerated but recognizable workflow that escalates through increasingly desperate and unprofessional steps, culminating in meta-humor about the cycle repeating."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Git repository go to therapy? It had too many unresolved conflicts, abandonment issues from orphaned branches, and its parents kept arguing about which HEAD to follow."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated meta-humor that personifies a Git repository with multiple layers of psychological problems, each mapping to actual Git concepts (merge conflicts, dangling branches, detached HEAD), creating a rich tapestry of technical and emotional parallels."
  rating: 9

- text: "I finally achieved Git enlightenment: I realized that 'git push --force' isn't a command, it's a lifestyle choice. A terrible, terrible lifestyle choice that I make anyway because the alternative is admitting I don't understand rebase."
  explanation: "This joke combines self-aware humor with the relief theory, acknowledging the dangerous practice of force pushing while admitting the deeper truth that it often stems from incomplete understanding - creating humor through radical honesty about technical inadequacy that most developers secretly relate to."
