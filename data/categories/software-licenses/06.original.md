- text: "I read the MIT License. Turns out I still can't do machine learning."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'MIT' - both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (famous for AI research) and the MIT software license. The humor comes from the unexpected shift from expecting information about software permissions to a commentary on personal technical skills."

- text: "Why did the developer choose the Apache License? He wanted his code to be free, but not *that* free."
  explanation: "This joke references the difference between permissive licenses (like Apache) and copyleft licenses (like GPL). The Apache License allows more flexibility while still maintaining some protections, creating a humorous middle ground in the 'freedom' spectrum of open source."

- text: "My code is like the GPL - everyone can see it, but nobody wants to touch it."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that plays on GPL's requirement to share source code. The joke suggests the code quality is so poor that even with full access, no one wants to work with it, inverting the usual appeal of open source collaboration."

- text: "I tried to fork a proprietary repository. Now I have a court date."
  explanation: "This joke uses 'fork' in its technical Git sense while the punchline reveals the speaker literally tried to copy proprietary software illegally. The incongruity between casual open-source terminology and serious legal consequences creates the humor."

- text: "What's the difference between open source and free software? About 50 pages of philosophical debate."
  explanation: "This references the famous distinction Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation make between 'free software' and 'open source' - a debate that has generated extensive documentation and passionate arguments in the tech community."

- text: "Creative Commons: Because sometimes you want credit, but not money, but also not derivatives, but maybe derivatives, and definitely not commercial use, unless..."
  explanation: "This joke captures the complexity of Creative Commons licensing with its many permutations (BY, SA, NC, ND) and how trying to specify exact terms can become absurdly complicated."

- text: "I released my code under the WTFPL. My lawyer released himself from representing me."
  explanation: "The WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License) is a real, extremely permissive license. The humor comes from the contrast between this casual, profane license and the formal legal profession's reaction to it."

- text: "Why don't proprietary software companies go to therapy? They have commitment issues with long-term support."
  explanation: "This plays on the common complaint about proprietary software vendors abandoning products or ending support unexpectedly, framing it as a psychological 'commitment issue' like in personal relationships."

- text: "My startup's business model: take GPL code, rename variables, sell as proprietary. My lawyer says I have a great future - in prison."
  explanation: "This joke highlights a serious GPL violation (taking copyleft code and making it proprietary) while using the setup-punchline structure to reveal the obviously illegal nature of this 'business model.'"

- text: "Open source is like a potluck dinner. Everyone brings something, but someone always shows up empty-handed and leaves with five containers."
  explanation: "This metaphor captures the tension in open source communities between contributors and users who only take without giving back, addressing the sustainability challenge in a relatable way."

- text: "I chose the BSD license because I like living dangerously - anyone can do anything with my code, including pretend they wrote it."
  explanation: "BSD licenses are highly permissive and don't require attribution in binary distributions. The joke frames this extreme permissiveness as 'living dangerously,' like a risky lifestyle choice."

- text: "Why did the corporation embrace open source? They realized 'free labor' sounds better than 'unpaid contributors.'"
  explanation: "This joke provides social commentary on how corporations benefit from open source contributions, using the reframing technique to highlight the economic dynamics at play with a cynical twist."

- text: "My code is dual-licensed: GPL for people I like, and 'please don't look at this' for everyone else."
  explanation: "This plays on the concept of dual-licensing (offering software under multiple licenses) but makes it absurdly personal and emotional rather than the usual commercial/open-source split."

- text: "What do you call a programmer who reads the entire GPL v3 license? A liar."
  explanation: "The GPL v3 is notoriously long and complex (over 5,000 words). This joke uses the superiority theory - we all pretend to understand licenses, but few actually read them completely."

- text: "I wanted to use AGPL for my project, but then I realized I'd have to explain what AGPL means for the rest of my life."
  explanation: "The AGPL (Affero GPL) is one of the most complex and misunderstood licenses, designed to close the 'SaaS loophole.' The joke captures the exhaustion of constantly explaining nuanced licensing terms."

- text: "Proprietary software is just open source with trust issues and a paywall."
  explanation: "This aphorism inverts the usual perspective by describing proprietary software in terms of what it lacks compared to open source, using psychological terminology ('trust issues') for humorous effect."

- text: "Why did the developer get arrested at the library? He was caught redistributing copyrighted material. The book was titled 'Understanding Software Licenses.'"
  explanation: "This meta-joke creates irony by having someone violate copyright law with a book about copyright law, and specifically about software licenses, creating multiple layers of contradiction."

- text: "My company's license agreement is 47 pages long. Page 23 says 'If you're actually reading this, email us for a free t-shirt.' We've never sent a t-shirt."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the reality that almost nobody reads End User License Agreements (EULAs), using a specific detail (the t-shirt offer) to make the humor concrete and relatable."

- text: "Open source: where 'free as in freedom' meets 'free as in nobody's getting paid' and they fight to the death."
  explanation: "This captures the fundamental tension in open source between ideological freedom and economic sustainability, using the famous 'free as in freedom, not free beer' distinction as a starting point for conflict."

- text: "I put my code under the Unlicense. My manager put me under review. HR put me under investigation. Legal put me under a cease-and-desist. I put my resume under update."
  explanation: "This escalating joke shows the cascading consequences of choosing an extremely permissive license in a corporate environment, with each department getting involved and the situation spiraling out of control, ending with the inevitable job search."

- text: "Why do licenses have version numbers? Because 'GPL v1: We tried' and 'GPL v2: We really tried' and 'GPL v3: Okay, we're covering EVERYTHING now' wouldn't fit on the documentation."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes the evolution of the GPL license, suggesting each version was a response to people finding loopholes, and captures the escalating complexity as license authors tried to close every possible gap in protection."
