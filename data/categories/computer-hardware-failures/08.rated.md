- text: "My hard drive crashed. Now it's just a hard drive."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'hard drive' - once it crashes, it's no longer functioning as a drive, just a hard (useless) object. The humor comes from the literal interpretation of the name after failure."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the RAM go to therapy? It had too many issues to address."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'address' - both as a psychological term (addressing issues) and the technical term for memory locations in RAM. The incongruity creates humor by applying human problems to hardware."
  rating: 7

- text: "My computer's cooling fan died. Things are getting heated between us."
  explanation: "This joke uses the literal overheating problem as a metaphor for relationship tension, creating humor through the unexpected application of hardware failure to human emotional dynamics."
  rating: 5

- text: "The motherboard failed. Guess it couldn't handle being a single parent to all those components."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the motherboard's role in connecting all computer components, comparing hardware failure to family stress. The incongruity between technical failure and parenting creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't broken hard drives ever win arguments? They can't make a good point - they keep skipping."
  explanation: "This references the physical behavior of failing hard drives (skipping sectors) and applies it to debate skills, creating humor through the unexpected connection between mechanical failure and rhetorical ability."
  rating: 6

- text: "My graphics card died during a game. At least it went out doing what it loved."
  explanation: "This applies the sentimental phrase typically used for human deaths to hardware failure, creating humor through the absurdity of mourning a graphics card with the same language used for people."
  rating: 8

- text: "The power supply failed. I guess it just couldn't handle the current situation."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'current' - both electrical current and present circumstances - to create wordplay. The pun on power supply's function generates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the SSD refuse to work? It had a chip on its shoulder."
  explanation: "This plays on 'chip' meaning both a grudge (idiom) and the actual flash memory chips in SSDs. The joke works through applying human emotional problems to hardware construction."
  rating: 6

- text: "My keyboard died mid-sentence. I can't even finish this j"
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates its own punchline by literally cutting off, mimicking the actual experience of hardware failure. The meta-humor comes from the format matching the content."
  rating: 9

- text: "The CPU overheated and shut down. Apparently, it couldn't handle the pressure of being the center of attention."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the CPU's central role in computing, comparing thermal throttling to performance anxiety. The humor arises from treating hardware failure as a psychological breakdown."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do failing hard drives make terrible storytellers? They always lose the plot."
  explanation: "This references data loss and sector failures while using the idiom 'lose the plot.' The double meaning creates humor by connecting mechanical failure to narrative incompetence."
  rating: 8

- text: "My monitor went black. It's not a phase, Mom - it's a hardware failure."
  explanation: "This parodies teenage rebellion language, applying it to a monitor failure. The humor comes from treating hardware malfunction as an identity crisis, with the parent-child dynamic adding absurdity."
  rating: 8

- text: "The network card failed during an important video call. It just couldn't connect with people anymore."
  explanation: "This uses 'connect' in both its technical and emotional senses, creating humor by treating network hardware failure as social anxiety or depression, reflecting modern isolation fears."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the RAID array go to couples counseling? Because mirror mode wasn't working and striping was causing too much tension."
  explanation: "This joke requires deeper technical knowledge of RAID configurations (mirroring and striping) and treats them as relationship dynamics, creating humor through the absurd application of therapy concepts to storage technology."
  rating: 8

- text: "My computer crashed right before saving. The universe has a garbage collection problem."
  explanation: "This applies the programming concept of garbage collection to cosmic justice, suggesting the universe itself has memory management issues. The humor comes from escalating a personal hardware failure to a universal programming bug."
  rating: 9

- text: "The BIOS chip failed. Now my computer has an existential crisis every time I turn it on - it doesn't even know how to boot."
  explanation: "This treats BIOS failure as philosophical confusion, with 'boot' working both as startup and the idiom 'bootstrap yourself.' The joke connects hardware initialization failure to existential philosophy."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do dead pixels make the best philosophers? They've achieved true enlightenment - they're permanently stuck in one state of being."
  explanation: "This references Buddhist concepts of enlightenment while describing the technical reality of stuck pixels. The humor comes from treating a hardware defect as spiritual achievement, inverting the problem into wisdom."
  rating: 9

- text: "My backup drive failed. Turns out it was just practicing for when I really needed it."
  explanation: "This joke captures the dark irony familiar to IT professionals - backup systems failing at critical moments. The humor comes from anthropomorphizing the drive as deliberately sabotaging through 'practice,' highlighting Murphy's Law."
  rating: 10

- text: "The thermal paste dried up and the CPU started throttling. I told it to chill, but it just got more heated about the situation."
  explanation: "This creates a recursive loop of temperature-related wordplay (chill, heated) while describing actual thermal management failure. The humor builds through the absurdity of arguing with overheating hardware using temperature idioms."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the capacitor file for divorce? After years of marriage, it realized it was in a toxic relationship - literally leaking."
  explanation: "This joke works on multiple levels: capacitor plague (actual hardware issue), toxic relationships (human drama), and literal chemical leakage. The technical knowledge of failing capacitors combines with relationship metaphors for sophisticated humor."

- text: "Three hard drives walk into a data center. The first one says 'I've got bad sectors.' The second says 'I'm experiencing mechanical failure.' The third says nothing - it's already dead. The RAID controller says 'Great, now I have to do EVERYTHING myself.' Two weeks later, the controller fails from stress. The IT admin looks at the wreckage and whispers: 'Should've gone with cloud storage.' From the corner, an old tape backup system chuckles: 'Kids these days...'"
  explanation: "This extended joke builds through layers: setup with multiple failing drives, RAID controller overwhelmed (itself becoming a point of failure), the punchline about cloud storage (modern solution), and the twist ending with tape backup (oldest technology) having the last laugh. It satirizes the entire evolution of storage technology while demonstrating that every solution eventually becomes the problem, and old technology outlasts trendy solutions. The humor comes from the recursive nature of failure, the personification of increasingly complex storage systems, and the ironic wisdom of obsolete technology."
