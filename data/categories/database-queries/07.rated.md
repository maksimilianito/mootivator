- text: "My SQL query returned 0 rows. Guess it's on a coffee break."
  explanation: "A simple play on the frustration of empty result sets, personifying the query as if it were a lazy employee. The humor comes from treating a technical outcome as if it had human agency and needs."
  rating: 4

- text: "Why did the database administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the higher-level joins."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'higher-level' - both as a physical height requiring a ladder and as a technical concept in SQL joins. The incongruity between physical and abstract creates the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "SELECT * FROM problems WHERE solution IS NOT NULL; -- Returns empty set"
  explanation: "This joke uses actual SQL syntax to express a programmer's frustration. The humor comes from the relatable experience that problems rarely come with obvious solutions, expressed through database query logic."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my database a joke about NULL values, but it didn't get it."
  explanation: "A play on NULL representing the absence of data - if the database 'didn't get it,' that could mean it returned NULL for understanding. The joke works on the ambiguity between human comprehension and database states."
  rating: 6

- text: "My queries are like my relationships: too many unnecessary joins and always timing out."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor comparing inefficient SQL queries to personal life. The technical concepts of 'joins' (database relationships) and 'timing out' (query failures) mirror romantic relationship problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? Because they always show their indexes."
  explanation: "Wordplay on 'showing your hand' in poker versus database indexes which expose the structure of data. The humor comes from applying gambling strategy to database optimization concepts."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to write a query to find happiness. Got a syntax error on line 1: 'unrealistic expectations'."
  explanation: "Uses the format of a database error message to deliver philosophical humor. The incongruity between querying for abstract emotions and receiving technical error messages creates the comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a database's favorite exercise? INNER JOIN squats - they really work those relationships."
  explanation: "Combines fitness culture with SQL syntax. INNER JOIN is a fundamental database operation, and the joke treats it as a physical exercise that strengthens 'relationships' (both database and personal)."
  rating: 5

- text: "My boss asked for a quick query. Three LEFT JOINs later, I'm still explaining why it takes 10 minutes to run."
  explanation: "Captures the common workplace scenario where 'simple' requests become complex. The humor lies in the gap between management expectations and technical reality, with LEFT JOINs being notoriously performance-heavy."
  rating: 7

- text: "Database administrator's pickup line: 'Are you a foreign key? Because you complete my relationship.'"
  explanation: "A nerdy pickup line using database terminology. Foreign keys create relationships between tables, making this a surprisingly romantic technical metaphor that works on both literal and figurative levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "I optimized my query from 3 hours to 3 seconds. My manager asked what I did all week."
  explanation: "Highlights the invisible nature of optimization work. The humor comes from the frustration that dramatic performance improvements often look like 'doing nothing' to non-technical observers."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the query go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies and commitment issues with transactions."
  explanation: "Personifies database queries with human psychological problems. Technical concepts like dependencies and transaction commits are reframed as emotional baggage, creating layered humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE clue > 0; -- Query returned 0 rows from management table"
  explanation: "A cheeky jab at management using SQL syntax. The joke structure mimics actual code with a comment revealing the punchline, making it feel authentic to developers while delivering workplace humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "My date asked if I was romantic. I said 'Baby, I'd cross join with you any day.' She left. I got a Cartesian product of loneliness."
  explanation: "CROSS JOIN creates a Cartesian product (every possible combination), which is usually a mistake. The joke layers the technical disaster of an accidental CROSS JOIN with romantic rejection, then extends the metaphor to describe the resulting loneliness."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do SQL developers make terrible comedians? Their jokes are too normalized - they've removed all the redundancy and now nothing makes sense."
  explanation: "Database normalization removes redundancy to improve efficiency, but humor often relies on setup and repetition. This meta-joke about joke structure uses database concepts to explain why overly efficient humor fails."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked the database for advice. It said: 'Error: Cannot INSERT wisdom WHERE experience = NULL.'"
  explanation: "Philosophical humor wrapped in SQL syntax. The joke suggests you can't gain wisdom without experience, expressed as a database constraint violation. The technical format elevates a common truism."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's queries? The junior uses SELECT *, the senior uses SELECT * with shame."
  explanation: "SELECT * is considered bad practice but incredibly convenient. This joke captures the evolution of programmer maturity - from ignorant bliss to knowing better but doing it anyway, which is even funnier."
  rating: 9

- text: "My query walked into a bar. The bartender said 'Sorry, we're fully locked.' It replied 'That's fine, I'll just wait for the transaction to commit.' It's still waiting."
  explanation: "A bar-joke format meets database deadlock humor. When transactions lock resources, queries wait indefinitely. The image of a query literally waiting at a bar for a transaction to finish creates absurdist humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the database break up with NoSQL? It said 'I need structure in my life, and you're just too schemaless for me.'"
  explanation: "A relationship joke about the fundamental philosophical difference between SQL (structured) and NoSQL (flexible) databases. The technical debate becomes a compatibility issue in a romantic relationship."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a recursive query to find meaning in life. Stack overflow occurred at depth 42. Turns out Douglas Adams was right, but my database couldn't handle the answer."
  explanation: "Multiple layers of humor: recursive queries can cause stack overflow, '42' references Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the answer to life), and the joke suggests even when you find life's meaning, your system can't process it."
  rating: 10

- text: "A query optimizer walks into a bar. It immediately rearranges all the tables, tells everyone to form better relationships, demands indexes from the bartender, then leaves without ordering because it determined the whole operation wasn't worth executing."
  explanation: "The ultimate database joke - personifying a query optimizer doing exactly what it does to queries: rearranging operations, optimizing joins (relationships), checking indexes, and sometimes deciding not to execute at all. The absurdity of applying database optimization to a social situation creates rich, multi-layered humor."
