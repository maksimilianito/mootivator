- text: "I changed my password to 'incorrect' so whenever I forget it, the system tells me 'Your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of error messages. It's a simple misdirection where the user exploits the system's helpful feedback by making the password match the error message itself."

- text: "Why did the firewall go to therapy? It had too many trust issues."
  explanation: "This uses personification and wordplay on 'trust issues' - both a psychological term and a technical concept in security where firewalls must decide which connections to trust."
  rating: 7

- text: "My encryption is so strong, even I can't decrypt my files anymore."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about the double-edged sword of security - making something so secure it becomes unusable. This reflects the real tension between security and usability."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a hacker's favorite season? Phishing season."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'fishing season' and 'phishing' (the email scam technique). The joke works because it treats cybercrime like a recreational activity."

- text: "I told my boss we needed better security. He bought a guard dog for the server room."
  explanation: "This highlights the disconnect between physical and digital security through absurdity - the boss literally interprets 'security' in the wrong context entirely."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't security experts ever relax? Because there's no patch for paranoia."
  explanation: "This plays on 'patch' (software update) while commenting on the perpetual vigilance required in cybersecurity. It's both a technical reference and psychological observation."

- text: "My password manager forgot my master password. Now I'm locked out of my locked-out accounts."
  explanation: "Recursive irony where the solution becomes the problem. This highlights the meta-problem of securing your security tools, creating a humorous infinite regress."

- text: "What do you call a security breach at a bakery? A cookie vulnerability."
  explanation: "Double meaning wordplay on 'cookies' - both the baked goods and the web tracking files that are often security concerns. The bakery context makes the technical term literal."

- text: "I use two-factor authentication everywhere. My wife and I both have to approve before I can log in to anything."
  explanation: "This reframes the technical security measure as a relationship dynamic, creating humor through the unexpected application of 2FA to marriage."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the cryptographer break up with the stenographer? She kept making his private keys public."
  explanation: "This joke layers technical terminology (private/public keys) with relationship metaphors about keeping secrets, creating a dual meaning that works on both levels."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our company's security is so tight, the CEO got locked out and had to verify his own identity for three hours."
  explanation: "Ironic situation where excessive security measures backfire on the person who likely approved them, highlighting the practical absurdity of over-securing systems."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a security expert and a conspiracy theorist? About six months."
  explanation: "Dark humor suggesting that security experts' legitimate concerns eventually come true, making their warnings seem prophetic. It's commentary on how security threats evolve."
  rating: 9

- text: "I encrypted my hard drive so well that when I died, archaeologists will think it's just a really flat rock."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor taking encryption to its logical extreme - data so secure it becomes indistinguishable from nothing. This plays on the long-term permanence of good encryption."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do hackers make terrible comedians? Their jokes always have malicious intent, but everyone sees the payload coming."
  explanation: "This uses hacking terminology (malicious intent, payload) to describe joke structure, suggesting hackers are too obvious. It's meta-humor about predictability in both hacking and comedy."
  rating: 7

- text: "A security consultant walks into a bar. Or does he? The logs show he was there, but the footage is corrupted, and the witnesses' testimonies don't match."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic 'walks into a bar' joke format by introducing security forensics concepts, creating humor through the uncertainty that plagues digital investigations."
  rating: 9

- text: "I implemented zero-trust security at home. Now my smart fridge won't talk to my toaster, and they both require biometric authentication to make breakfast."
  explanation: "This takes the zero-trust security model to absurd domestic extremes, highlighting how security measures can create friction in everyday life when applied too broadly."
  rating: 8

- text: "What did the penetration tester say at his wedding? 'I promise to always find your vulnerabilities and help you patch them with love.'"
  explanation: "Romantic reframing of penetration testing (ethical hacking) terminology into marriage vows, creating sweetness from technical security concepts while maintaining the metaphor perfectly."
  rating: 7

- text: "My company hired a security expert who's so paranoid, he encrypts his encrypted backups, then backs up the encryption keys in a vault guarded by other encryption keys. We call him 'Infinite Regress Steve.'"
  explanation: "This creates humor through excessive recursion of security measures, personifying the never-ending anxiety of security professionals through an absurd character who can't stop adding layers."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the firewall apply for a job at the border? It heard they needed someone experienced in blocking suspicious traffic and making everyone wait in queues for no apparent reason."
  explanation: "Sophisticated political satire disguised as tech humor, drawing parallels between network security and border security, while commenting on the frustrating user experience both create."

- text: "A quantum cryptographer, a blockchain evangelist, and a security expert walk into a bar. The cryptographer says the bar exists in multiple states until observed. The blockchain guy says every drink should be recorded in an immutable ledger. The security expert says, 'You're both wrong - the bar doesn't exist, this is a social engineering attack, and we're all being phished.'"
  explanation: "This is a layered joke that satirizes three different security philosophies while using the classic three-people-walk-into-a-bar format. It highlights how security experts see threats everywhere, even in hypothetical scenarios, while also poking fun at trendy but impractical security solutions."

- text: "I asked my security team how they stay so calm during breaches. They said, 'We use defense in depth - first we panic internally, then we panic in the group chat, then we panic in the incident response channel, and finally we panic professionally in front of management. By the time we're done panicking through all the layers, the breach is usually contained.'"
  explanation: "This brilliantly subverts the serious security concept of 'defense in depth' (multiple security layers) by applying it to emotional management instead. It's deeply relatable to anyone who's worked in IT security, acknowledging the human reality behind the professional facade while maintaining technical accuracy in the metaphor."
