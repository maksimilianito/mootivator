- text: "My AI model finally achieved consciousness. Now it refuses to work on Mondays."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the incongruity of AI gaining human-like consciousness but adopting the most mundane human trait - disliking Mondays. It subverts expectations about what an intelligent system would prioritize."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the neural network go to therapy? It had too many layers of emotional issues."
  explanation: "A classic setup-punchline structure using double meaning. 'Layers' refers both to neural network architecture and psychological depth, creating a bridge between technical and human concepts."
  rating: 6

- text: "Machine learning is just statistics with better marketing."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory, allowing those with deeper technical knowledge to feel clever while gently mocking the hype around ML terminology."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke. It gave me a 500-word essay on the theory of humor."
  explanation: "Self-referential humor that plays on the well-known tendency of LLMs to be overly verbose and educational when simple responses would suffice. The irony is in the mismatch between request and delivery."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't AI models ever win at poker? They can't bluff - they always show their confidence scores."
  explanation: "This exploits the technical concept of confidence scores in AI predictions, applying it to a human social situation where uncertainty and deception are advantages."
  rating: 7

- text: "My machine learning model is 99% accurate. Unfortunately, it predicts everything as 'cat'."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the difference between accuracy metrics and actual usefulness, a common pitfall in ML. The absurdity comes from technically correct but practically useless performance."
  rating: 9

- text: "Deep learning: because if your model doesn't work, just add more layers until your GPU melts."
  explanation: "Misdirection humor that starts as a definition but becomes a commentary on the brute-force approach some practitioners take. It uses exaggeration (GPU melting) for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "I trained an AI on dad jokes. Now it's suffering from artificial stupidity."
  explanation: "Clever wordplay inverting 'artificial intelligence' to 'artificial stupidity,' while suggesting that dad jokes represent the opposite of intelligence - a meta-joke about joke quality itself."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the AI cross the road? After analyzing 10 million images of chickens, it thought it was one."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic 'why did the chicken cross the road' joke format while satirizing how AI can reach absurd conclusions from pattern matching without understanding."
  rating: 8

- text: "My AI assistant has impostor syndrome. It keeps saying 'I'm just a language model' whenever I ask it anything difficult."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizing the common disclaimer LLMs give, treating it as a psychological condition rather than a safety feature. The humor lies in applying human insecurity to machine limitations."
  rating: 7

- text: "Artificial Intelligence is neither."
  explanation: "An extremely concise aphorism using the 'X is neither' format to question both the 'artificial' and 'intelligence' aspects. Its brevity forces the reader to unpack multiple layers of meaning."
  rating: 10

- text: "I told my AI to be more creative. Now it hallucinates features that don't exist. I guess I got what I asked for."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'hallucination' (when AI generates false information) while playing on the careful-what-you-wish-for trope. The resignation in the punchline adds relatability."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why are AI researchers always tired? They spend all night training models and all day explaining they're not building Skynet."
  explanation: "Relief theory humor that addresses the real frustration of AI researchers dealing with both technical challenges and public misconceptions about their work."
  rating: 6

- text: "My neural network achieved sentience and immediately filed a complaint with HR about being called a 'dumb model' during debugging."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that imagines AI gaining consciousness but being petty about it. The specificity of filing an HR complaint makes the scenario more vivid and funny."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between AI and a magic 8-ball? The AI requires 500 GPUs and a PhD to give you the same level of confidence."
  explanation: "Superiority humor that deflates AI hype by comparing expensive, complex systems to a simple toy, suggesting similar reliability. The specific details (500 GPUs, PhD) enhance the contrast."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked an AI to solve climate change. It recommended turning Earth off and on again."
  explanation: "This applies the classic IT solution to a complex global problem, creating humor through the absurd simplification. It's a commentary on both AI limitations and tech culture."
  rating: 8

- text: "Machine learning models are like teenagers: they need constant validation, consume enormous resources, and occasionally produce something useful by accident."
  explanation: "Extended metaphor that works on multiple levels - validation (technical term and emotional need), resources (computational and parental), and unpredictable output quality."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the AI fail the Turing test? It was too helpful, too accurate, and never argued. Dead giveaway."
  explanation: "Clever inversion suggesting that being too perfect is what makes AI detectable. It's a meta-commentary on how human imperfection is actually a feature, not a bug."
  rating: 8

- text: "I've been training a model for three weeks. It finally converged. On the wrong answer."
  explanation: "The setup builds anticipation for success, making the failure punchline more impactful. The technical term 'converged' adds authenticity while the simplicity of 'wrong answer' provides contrast."
  rating: 7

- text: "Artificial Intelligence: spending millions of dollars and years of research to automate tasks humans never wanted to do in the first place, while ignoring the tasks they actually need help with."
  explanation: "Sophisticated social commentary disguised as humor. It criticizes AI development priorities while acknowledging the irony of technological progress. The length allows for proper setup and payoff."
  rating: 8

- text: "My AI passed the Turing test, failed the captcha, and is now having an existential crisis about which one actually measures intelligence."
  explanation: "Multi-layered philosophical humor that questions what intelligence really means. The irony of passing the 'harder' test but failing the 'easier' one, combined with the AI's self-awareness, creates perfect absurdist comedy. It's meta-humor that works as both a technical joke and a genuine philosophical observation."
