- text: "I moved my files to the cloud, but it started raining and now I can't find them."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of 'cloud' computing, creating incongruity between the metaphorical cloud storage and actual weather clouds. It's a simple misunderstanding joke that highlights how non-technical people might perceive cloud terminology."
  rating: 4

- text: "Why did the server go to therapy? It had too many issues with attachment."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning - 'attachment' refers both to email attachments in cloud services and emotional attachment issues. The personification of a server seeking therapy creates absurdity while playing on technical terminology."
  rating: 6

- text: "My company switched to the cloud to save money. Now we just pay monthly forever instead of once."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the ironic reality of cloud computing economics - the shift from capital expenditure to operational expenditure. The humor comes from the realization that 'saving money' often means perpetual payments rather than actual savings."
  rating: 8

- text: "Cloud computing: because 'someone else's computer' didn't sound professional enough."
  explanation: "This aphorism reveals the fundamental truth behind cloud computing's marketing. The incongruity between the ethereal 'cloud' branding and the mundane reality of remote servers creates humor through demystification."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my boss I'm working in the cloud now. He asked why I'm on the roof with my laptop."
  explanation: "Another literal interpretation joke that creates a visual absurdity. The misdirection between technical jargon and physical location generates humor through the boss's misunderstanding."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why don't clouds ever get lost? They always know their IP address."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'clouds' (weather and computing) while incorporating a technical element (IP addresses). The anthropomorphization of clouds combined with networking concepts creates a layered joke."
  rating: 5

- text: "Virtualization: the art of pretending one computer is many computers, so many computers can pretend to be one computer."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the paradoxical and recursive nature of virtualization technology. The circular logic and complexity wrapped in simple language creates humor through the absurdity of the concept itself."
  rating: 8

- text: "My data is in three availability zones. I'm still not available when my boss calls."
  explanation: "This creates humor by contrasting technical redundancy and personal availability. The setup establishes cloud reliability concepts, then subverts expectations by applying them to human behavior instead."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the startup choose serverless? They couldn't afford the servers anyway."
  explanation: "This joke exposes the economic reality behind technology choices. The term 'serverless' is revealed to be both technically accurate and ironically literal for cash-strapped companies."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my disaster recovery plan, but when I do, it's during an actual disaster."
  explanation: "This uses the 'most interesting man' meme format to highlight a common IT failure. The dark humor comes from the recognition that many organizations only discover their backup flaws when it's too late."
  rating: 9

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer, until something breaks. Then it's YOUR problem."
  explanation: "This aphorism captures the false sense of security in cloud computing. The shift from detachment to ownership when issues arise creates humor through the recognition of shared responsibility models."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer break up with their on-premise infrastructure? They needed more space and the relationship wasn't scalable."
  explanation: "This personifies the infrastructure migration decision as a relationship problem. The use of technical terms like 'scalable' in an emotional context creates humor through category confusion."
  rating: 6

- text: "I put everything in the cloud for redundancy. Now I have three copies of files I can't find."
  explanation: "This highlights the irony that increased redundancy doesn't always equal increased usability. The joke plays on the gap between theoretical reliability and practical accessibility."
  rating: 7

- text: "Elastic computing means your infrastructure grows with demand. Also, your bill."
  explanation: "This short, punchy aphorism captures the double-edged sword of auto-scaling. The parallel structure sets up an expectation of pure benefit, then delivers the financial reality as the punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do cloud engineers make terrible meteorologists? They think every cloud has a silver lining, and that lining costs $0.02 per GB."
  explanation: "This joke combines the cloud metaphor with the optimistic idiom 'silver lining,' then grounds it in the specific reality of cloud pricing. The specificity of the pricing adds authenticity and unexpected detail."
  rating: 8

- text: "My boss asked if our data is secure in the cloud. I said yes, it's protected by a very strong password: 'Password123'. He seemed relieved."
  explanation: "This creates humor through dramatic irony - the audience knows the password is terrible while the boss remains ignorant. It satirizes both security theater and management's technical knowledge gaps."
  rating: 7

- text: "I migrated to a multi-cloud strategy for redundancy. Now when something breaks, I get to troubleshoot three different platforms simultaneously."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the expected benefit of multi-cloud architecture. The setup promises reliability, but the punchline reveals the complexity cost, creating humor through the recognition of unintended consequences."
  rating: 8

- text: "Serverless doesn't mean no servers. It means you can't fix them when they break, but you still pay for them when they don't."
  explanation: "This aphorism exposes multiple layers of serverless computing irony. The logical structure builds complexity while maintaining clarity, and the economic reality provides the sting in the tail."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the company's cloud migration fail? They lifted and shifted their problems along with their applications."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'lift and shift' while highlighting that technology migration doesn't solve organizational or architectural problems. The humor comes from the recognition that geography doesn't fix fundamental issues."
  rating: 8

- text: "I love how 'cloud native' means you're locked into one vendor's ecosystem, but 'on-premise' means you're just old-fashioned."
  explanation: "This joke reveals the marketing doublespeak in cloud computing terminology. The contrast between the positive spin on vendor lock-in versus the negative framing of independence creates satirical humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "A developer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'You can choose: Heaven has infinite compute and storage, but it's all on-premise. Hell has the latest serverless architecture, but AWS is down 20% of the time.' The developer thinks for a moment and asks, 'Which region is Hell in?'"
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated joke that works on multiple levels: it satirizes developers' priorities (technology over comfort), the reality of cloud outages, the obsession with regions and availability, and the idea that even eternal damnation is acceptable if the tech stack is modern. The punchline reveals the developer has already chosen Hell but is just checking the technical specifications, which perfectly captures the developer mindset of prioritizing technical details over everything else."
