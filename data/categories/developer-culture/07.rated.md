- text: "Why do developers hate nature? Too many bugs and not enough documentation."
  explanation: "This applies programming frustrations (bugs and lack of documentation) to the natural world, creating humor through the absurdity of evaluating nature by software development standards."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our team's definition of 'legacy code' is anything written before lunch."
