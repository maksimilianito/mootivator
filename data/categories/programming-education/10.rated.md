- text: "My first program was 'Hello World.' My second program was 'Goodbye, Sanity.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the traditional first program every student writes, contrasting the innocent beginning with the overwhelming complexity that follows in programming education. The progression from 'Hello' to 'Goodbye' mirrors the emotional journey of learning to code."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programming students love recursion? Because to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion."
  explanation: "This joke uses the self-referential nature of recursion itself to create humor. It's a meta-joke that demonstrates the concept it's describing, highlighting the circular confusion students often experience when first learning this concept."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my programming teacher for help with my code. He said, 'Have you tried turning it off and on again?' I said, 'That's my brain, not my computer.'"
  explanation: "This joke subverts the classic IT support advice by applying it to the student's mental state rather than the computer, acknowledging the mental exhaustion common in programming education."
  rating: 6

- text: "Learning to code is easy. They said. It'll be fun. They lied."
  explanation: "This joke uses the pattern of setting up false expectations followed by harsh reality, reflecting the common experience of students who underestimate programming's difficulty based on marketing materials or encouraging teachers."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the student bring a ladder to coding class? Because the teacher said they'd be learning high-level languages."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the double meaning of 'high-level' - both as a technical term for abstracted programming languages and as a literal physical description, creating incongruity through wordplay."
  rating: 6

- text: "My professor said I'd understand pointers eventually. I'm still not sure what he was pointing at."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the notorious difficulty of learning pointers in C/C++ while using the literal meaning of 'pointing' to create a pun. Pointers are famously one of the hardest concepts for students to grasp."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many programming students does it take to change a lightbulb? None. That's a hardware problem."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the traditional lightbulb joke format while highlighting the common student tendency to avoid anything outside their immediate domain, reflecting the software/hardware divide in education."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally understand object-oriented programming! Now I just need to understand why my objects won't orient."
  explanation: "This joke uses the literal interpretation of 'object-oriented' to highlight the gap between understanding terminology and actually implementing concepts, a common student frustration."
  rating: 7

- text: "My coding bootcamp promised I'd be job-ready in 12 weeks. They were right. I'm ready to job hunt for 12 months."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the optimistic promises of bootcamps by redefining 'job-ready' to mean ready to search for jobs rather than ready to perform them, reflecting the gap between education and employment."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do students prefer Python? Because it's the only snake that won't bite them... until runtime."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Python's reputation as beginner-friendly while acknowledging its dynamic typing can lead to unexpected runtime errors, teaching students that 'easy to learn' doesn't mean 'error-free.'"
  rating: 8

- text: "Professor: 'This assignment should take 2 hours.' Translation: 'This will consume your entire weekend and possibly your soul.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the notorious disconnect between instructors' time estimates and actual student experience, using the dramatic escalation from hours to soul-consuming for comedic effect."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote my first sorting algorithm. It works! It just takes three days to sort five numbers."
  explanation: "This joke celebrates the student achievement of creating working code while acknowledging the common beginner mistake of ignoring efficiency, creating humor through extreme underperformance."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the student fail the binary exam? He thought there were 10 types of people: those who understand binary and those who don't."
  explanation: "This meta-joke plays on the famous binary joke itself, suggesting the student memorized the joke without understanding the concept - a common pattern in programming education where students know memes but not fundamentals."
  rating: 9

- text: "My debugging process: 1) Panic. 2) Google. 3) Copy-paste from StackOverflow. 4) Panic because it still doesn't work. 5) Realize I'm in the wrong file."
  explanation: "This joke captures the authentic student debugging experience through escalating chaos, with the punchline revealing a face-palm moment that experienced programmers recognize immediately."
  rating: 10

- text: "They told me programming is just problem-solving. They forgot to mention the problems are mostly caused by your previous solutions."
  explanation: "This joke reveals the recursive nature of programming challenges where fixes create new issues, a frustrating reality students discover quickly that contradicts the clean problem-solving narrative."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't programming students sleep? Because they're stuck in an infinite loop of 'just one more bug.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses programming terminology (infinite loop) to describe the behavioral pattern of students unable to stop debugging, creating humor through the application of code concepts to human behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally fixed that bug that took me 6 hours to find. The solution? I removed a semicolon I added 6 hours ago."
  explanation: "This joke captures the tragicomic reality of programming education where students often create their own problems, with the circular nature of the situation providing the humor through irony."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code doesn't work and I don't know why. My code works and I don't know why. Which is worse? Yes."
  explanation: "This joke presents a paradox familiar to all students - the uncertainty of success being as troubling as failure. The answer 'Yes' to a choice question creates humor while validating both anxieties."
  rating: 10

- text: "Professor: 'Any questions?' Student: 'Yes, all of them.' Professor: 'Be more specific.' Student: 'I'm confused about everything after you said hello.'"
  explanation: "This joke escalates from general confusion to absurd specificity, capturing the overwhelming feeling when students are lost from the very beginning but don't know how to articulate their confusion."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked a senior student for advice on learning to code. He stared into the distance and whispered, 'Run.' Then he added, 'But first, learn to walk through your code with a debugger.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses dramatic storytelling with a fake-out warning that turns into actual practical advice, playing on the 'traumatized veteran' trope while delivering genuine wisdom about debugging."
  rating: 8

- text: "The four stages of programming education: 1) I don't understand anything. 2) I understand everything! 3) Wait, I don't understand anything. 4) I understand that I'll never understand everything, and that's okay."
  explanation: "This joke captures the complete emotional and intellectual journey of learning to code, from confusion through false confidence to the wisdom of accepting perpetual learning. The progression creates humor through recognition while offering genuine insight about the nature of programming expertise."
