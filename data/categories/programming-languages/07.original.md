```yaml
- text: "Python developers love indentation. It's their space to shine."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'space' as both whitespace (Python's syntactic requirement) and metaphorical room for excellence. The minimalist structure mirrors Python's philosophy of simplicity."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#."
  explanation: "A classic misdirection joke using programming language names as homophones. The setup suggests a vision problem, but the punchline pivots to the inability to see/use C# (C-sharp)."

- text: "Assembly language: where GOTO is not considered harmful, just inevitable."
  explanation: "References Dijkstra's famous paper 'Go To Statement Considered Harmful' while acknowledging that low-level assembly programming often requires direct jumps, creating ironic acceptance of what higher-level languages avoid."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes SQL syntax by applying the JOIN operation to a social situation. The double meaning of 'join' (database operation vs. social interaction) creates the humor through incongruity."

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't see sharp."
  explanation: "Similar structure to the C# joke but inverses the logic - Java developers can't see 'sharp' (C#), playing on language rivalry and the visual pun of eyesight."

- text: "Rust: where the compiler is your therapist, and every session is mandatory."
  explanation: "Captures Rust's famously strict borrow checker that forces developers to confront memory safety issues. The 'mandatory therapy' metaphor reflects both the difficulty and the ultimate benefit of Rust's approach."

- text: "I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it."
  explanation: "Exploits the technical difference between UDP (unreliable, no delivery guarantee) and TCP protocols. The meta-humor is that the joke itself demonstrates the very concept it's joking about."

- text: "Why did the functional programmer get lost? They couldn't handle the state of the map."
  explanation: "Double pun on 'state' (mutable data vs. condition) and 'map' (geographic tool vs. functional programming operation). Functional programming's avoidance of state creates the ironic predicament."

- text: "C programmers never die. They're just cast into void."
  explanation: "Uses C's 'void' type and casting mechanism as a metaphor for death/disappearance. The technical accuracy (casting to void pointer) combined with existential humor creates depth."

- text: "A Lisp programmer walks into a bar (((and orders a drink) with extra parentheses) because why not)."
  explanation: "Visually demonstrates Lisp's notorious abundance of parentheses by embedding them in the joke's structure itself. The self-referential nature makes the syntax the punchline."

- text: "Why do Haskell developers refuse to leave their houses? They're afraid of side effects."
  explanation: "Pure functional programming in Haskell avoids side effects (state changes). The joke extends this technical constraint to absurd real-world consequences, creating humor through exaggeration."

- text: "PHP: the language that's always trying to convince you it's changed, like an ex at 2 AM."
  explanation: "Commentary on PHP's reputation and ongoing evolution. The relatable social metaphor (desperate ex) combined with PHP's genuine improvement efforts creates sympathetic humor about language perception."

- text: "In Perl, there's more than one way to do it. In Python, there's preferably only one. In C++, there's no way you're doing it right."
  explanation: "Escalating comparison joke that captures each language's philosophy: Perl's TIMTOWTDI motto, Python's Zen, and C++'s complexity. The progression from freedom to restriction to impossibility creates comedic rhythm."

- text: "Why was the TypeScript developer so calm during the crisis? They had already handled all possible types of problems."
  explanation: "Plays on TypeScript's type system and the double meaning of 'types' (data types vs. categories). The joke suggests type safety provides psychological safety, absurdly extending technical benefits."

- text: "COBOL programmers don't retire. They just STOP RUN."
  explanation: "Uses actual COBOL syntax (STOP RUN terminates programs) as a euphemism for retirement. The joke works on recognition of archaic syntax and the aging COBOL programmer demographic."

- text: "A Go developer's favorite exercise? Goroutines. They're lightweight and run concurrently with your other responsibilities."
  explanation: "Extends Go's goroutines (lightweight threads) to personal life, suggesting programmers try to parallelize everything. The absurdity of treating life like concurrent programming creates relatable humor."

- text: "Why did the Kotlin developer break up with Java? They found someone more expressive with less baggage and better null safety."
  explanation: "Romantic relationship metaphor for language migration. Each phrase references actual Kotlin improvements (conciseness, modern features, null safety), making it both funny and technically informative."

- text: "Scala developers write code that's so elegant, even they can't understand it six months later."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about Scala's powerful but complex features. The irony that expressiveness leads to incomprehensibility captures a real tension in language design and practical software maintenance."

- text: "Why don't C++ developers ever finish their stories? They keep getting interrupted by exceptions they didn't catch, segfaults they didn't expect, and template errors that span 47 lines."
  explanation: "Escalating list of C++ pain points that mirrors the actual experience of debugging. The specificity ('47 lines' of template errors) adds authenticity while the interruption metaphor extends to storytelling."

- text: "A JavaScript developer walks into a bar. The bartender says 'We don't serve strings here.' The developer replies: `${bar}, I'll have a template literal then.`"
  explanation: "Multi-layered joke using actual ES6 template literal syntax in the punchline. The meta-humor of responding with the very feature being discussed, plus the visual code formatting, creates sophisticated technical comedy."

- text: "Why did the Brainfuck programmer go to therapy? Because after years of optimization, they realized they'd been optimizing the wrong thing - they needed to optimize their life, not their pointer movements. The therapist just said: '++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.' which somehow made perfect sense."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor about Brainfuck, the intentionally difficult esoteric language. The joke starts with relatable burnout, then escalates to absurdity with actual Brainfuck code as therapeutic advice. The final acceptance ('made perfect sense') satirizes how programmers rationalize working with terrible tools, while the code itself (which actually prints 'Hello World') adds an Easter egg for those who recognize it."
