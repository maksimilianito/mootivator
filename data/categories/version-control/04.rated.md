- text: "I tried to commit my changes, but Git said 'nothing to commit'. Story of my life."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'commit' - both as a Git command and as a personal life commitment, playing on the programmer's inability to commit in either context."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer always use Git? Because SVN was too controlling."
  explanation: "This plays on SVN's centralized control model versus Git's distributed nature, while also using 'controlling' in both a technical and relationship context."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code has more branches than a forest, and they're all dead."
  explanation: "This uses the Git concept of branches and applies it to nature, with the punchline being that abandoned branches are a common problem in version control."
  rating: 8

- text: "Version control is like a time machine, except you can only go back to moments when everything was also broken."
  explanation: "This subverts the expectation that version control lets you return to 'better times' by acknowledging that past code versions were often equally problematic."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer's confession: I've been committing crimes against code for years, and Git has all the evidence."
  explanation: "This plays on the legal meaning of 'committing crimes' versus Git commits, with the repository serving as a permanent record of all coding mistakes."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't version control systems ever get lonely? They always have their commits."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'commits' sounding like 'commitments', suggesting the repository has companions in its stored changes."
  rating: 4

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Then I git revert."
  explanation: "This references the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of testing in production, with git revert as the emergency escape."
  rating: 7

- text: "My Git history is like my browser history - I really hope no one ever looks at it."
  explanation: "This draws a humorous parallel between embarrassing browser history and the messy, often embarrassing commit history developers create."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite magic trick? Making bugs disappear with 'git blame' and pointing at someone else."
  explanation: "This jokes about the git blame command, which shows who wrote each line of code, and how it's often used to deflect responsibility for bugs."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally understand Git branching strategy: create branch, panic, merge master into branch, panic more, force push, update resume."
  explanation: "This escalating sequence humorously captures the chaos that often ensues when developers mismanage Git branches, ending with the ultimate consequence of job hunting."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SVN? She found someone more distributed and less committed to centralization."
  explanation: "This personifies version control systems in a relationship context, using Git's distributed nature versus SVN's centralized model as relationship qualities."
  rating: 6

- text: "Merge conflict: when Git asks you to choose between your code and your coworker's code, and you realize you both wrote garbage."
  explanation: "This highlights the awkward moment during merge conflicts when you discover that neither version of the code is actually good."
  rating: 8

- text: "I named my Git branch 'temporary-fix-delete-later'. That was three years ago. It's now in production serving millions of users."
  explanation: "This story-format joke captures the reality that temporary solutions often become permanent, despite everyone's best intentions."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between Git and a save point in a video game? In video games, you remember to save before the boss fight."
  explanation: "This compares Git commits to game saves, highlighting how developers often forget to commit before making risky changes."
  rating: 7

- text: "My Git workflow: commit, push, break production, revert, commit again, push, break production differently, cry, force push, get fired, git clone my career elsewhere."
  explanation: "This extended sequence humorously escalates from simple mistakes to career-ending decisions, with Git commands marking each stage of the disaster."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do developers love Git stash? Because it's the only place where hiding your problems actually works."
  explanation: "This plays on git stash as a temporary storage mechanism while metaphorically suggesting it's a way to avoid dealing with code issues."
  rating: 8

- text: "A senior developer's wisdom: 'git push --force' is not a problem-solving strategy, it's a career-ending strategy. I learned this the hard way. Twice."
  explanation: "This joke builds humor through the confession format, with the punchline being that they made the same catastrophic mistake multiple times."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my therapist I have commitment issues. She suggested I try Git. Now I have 47 uncommitted changes and even more anxiety."
  explanation: "This cleverly inverts the expectation that Git would help with commitment issues, instead making them worse through the metaphor of uncommitted code changes."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a version control system's favorite philosophy? 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' That's why we have git log."
  explanation: "This applies a famous George Santayana quote to version control, with git log serving as the repository's memory of past mistakes."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code review comment: 'This looks good, but I see you committed directly to master at 3 AM. Are you okay? Do you need to talk? Also, you're fired.'"
  explanation: "This joke builds through false concern that suddenly shifts to consequences, highlighting the serious taboo of committing directly to the main branch."
  rating: 8

- text: "Git is the only place where 'detached HEAD state' is a technical term and not a reason to call emergency services. Though honestly, both situations cause similar levels of panic."
  explanation: "This joke uses the absurdity of Git's terminology, comparing the technical state to a medical emergency, with the punchline acknowledging that developers react with similar panic to both."
