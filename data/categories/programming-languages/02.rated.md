- text: "Python is the only language where whitespace matters more than your opinion."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Python's unique syntax requirement of significant whitespace for code blocks, contrasting it with the strong opinions programmers typically have about coding style. The humor comes from the incongruity that in Python, invisible characters have absolute authority over human preferences."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#."
  explanation: "A simple pun combining programming language names (JavaScript, C#) with the common phrase about needing glasses to see. The misdirection comes from expecting a JavaScript-specific punchline but instead getting a play on the pronunciation of 'C sharp' as 'see sharp.'"
  rating: 4

- text: "Rust developers don't have bugs. They have 'lifetime issues.'"
  explanation: "This joke references Rust's unique lifetime system for memory management, reframing the universal problem of bugs as a language-specific feature. It employs the 'it's a feature, not a bug' pattern while also suggesting Rust developers might be in denial about problems."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a SQL query and uses the double meaning of 'JOIN' - both the social act of joining people and the SQL JOIN operation that combines tables. The setup creates a bar scene where database concepts become social interactions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C."
  explanation: "Similar to the earlier C# joke but specific to Java, this plays on Java's verbose nature and its historical competition with C. The humor works on the simple visual pun level while subtly commenting on language differences."
  rating: 3

- text: "COBOL programmers are never unemployed. They're just deprecated."
  explanation: "This joke uses programming terminology (deprecated) to describe employment status, playing on the fact that COBOL is an outdated language but still runs critical systems. It creates humor through the application of technical concepts to human career situations."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the functional programmer refuse to go to the party? Because they avoid side effects."
  explanation: "This references functional programming's core principle of avoiding side effects (unintended consequences of functions). The humor comes from applying this technical constraint to social situations, where 'side effects' could mean social consequences or hangovers."
  rating: 9

- text: "Assembly language: Where 'Hello World' takes 50 lines and your sanity takes a vacation."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates the verbosity and complexity of Assembly language by contrasting the simplest possible program with extreme line count. The personification of sanity 'taking a vacation' adds absurdity while expressing the genuine frustration of low-level programming."
  rating: 7

- text: "A C programmer walks into a bar and orders 1.0000001 beers. The bartender pours 1 beer. The programmer says, 'Close enough.'"
  explanation: "This joke illustrates floating-point precision errors common in C and other languages. The humor comes from the acceptance of imprecision as normal, which programmers deal with constantly but would be absurd in real-world transactions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do Haskell programmers always look confused? They're still trying to understand their code from yesterday."
  explanation: "This plays on Haskell's reputation for being highly abstract and difficult to read, even for the person who wrote it. The superiority theory applies here as it's self-deprecating humor about the complexity of functional programming paradigms."
  rating: 6

- text: "PHP: The language where you can write '$$$$$$$' and it's syntactically valid but semantically questionable."
  explanation: "This references PHP's variable syntax (starting with $) and creates absurdity by suggesting multiple dollar signs could be valid. It also subtly criticizes PHP's permissive syntax that allows confusing code, making it both technically accurate and humorous."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer's spouse says, 'While you're out, buy some milk.' They never returned."
  explanation: "This is a classic infinite loop joke where the condition 'while you're out' creates an endless loop since buying milk doesn't change the 'out' status. It's a perfect example of applying programming logic to real-world instructions with absurd consequences."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why don't Lisp programmers ever finish their sentences? Because they have too many ((((("
  explanation: "This joke plays on Lisp's notorious use of nested parentheses. The visual representation of unclosed parentheses creates both the setup and punchline simultaneously, while the incomplete sentence mirrors incomplete code blocks."
  rating: 8

- text: "Go developers don't have exceptions. They have 'if err != nil' for days."
  explanation: "This references Go's controversial error-handling approach that requires explicit checking rather than exceptions. The phrase 'for days' suggests repetitiveness and tedium, capturing the genuine frustration many developers feel with Go's verbose error handling."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Perl developer get lost? Because there's more than one way to do it, and they tried them all."
  explanation: "This directly references Perl's famous motto 'There's more than one way to do it' (TIMTOWTDI), creating humor by showing how this flexibility could lead to analysis paralysis. It's a gentle critique wrapped in absurdity."
  rating: 6

- text: "A TypeScript developer walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'We don't serve your type here.' The developer replies, 'That's okay, I'll just use any.'"
  explanation: "This multilayered joke uses 'type' as both a social categorization and TypeScript's type system, while the punchline references TypeScript's 'any' type that bypasses type checking - essentially the escape hatch that defeats the language's purpose."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Kotlin developer break up with Java? They found someone more expressive with less baggage."
  explanation: "This personifies programming languages in a relationship metaphor. Kotlin was designed to be more concise than Java while maintaining compatibility, so 'less baggage' works both as relationship terminology and technical description of reduced boilerplate code."
  rating: 7

- text: "Scala: Where you can write code so elegant that in six months you'll need a PhD to understand what you were thinking."
  explanation: "This joke captures Scala's power and complexity - it allows for extremely concise, elegant solutions that can become incomprehensible. The time element adds to the absurdity, suggesting even the author becomes confused by their own cleverness."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do Ruby developers always seem happy? Because everything is an object, including their feelings."
  explanation: "This references Ruby's pure object-oriented design where literally everything is an object. The joke anthropomorphizes the language philosophy, suggesting it extends to emotional states, creating a whimsical connection between programming paradigms and psychology."
  rating: 6

- text: "A Swift developer, a Rust developer, and a C++ developer walk into a bar. Only the Rust developer walks out - the other two had memory leaks and the bar claimed ownership."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke contrasts memory management approaches: Swift's ARC can have retain cycles, C++ requires manual management, while Rust's ownership system prevents such issues. The bar 'claiming ownership' is a clever play on Rust's ownership concept."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the Brainfuck developer become a zen master? Because after coding in Brainfuck, everything else is enlightenment."
  explanation: "Brainfuck is an esoteric language designed to be extremely difficult to use. This joke uses hyperbole and the misdirection of spiritual enlightenment to express that any other programming experience would seem blissful by comparison, creating humor through extreme contrast and absurdity."
