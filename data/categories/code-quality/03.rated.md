- text: "My code works, but I'm not sure why. Should I comment it 'magic' or 'do not touch'?"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common programmer experience of writing code that functions correctly but whose logic isn't entirely clear even to its author. The humor comes from the absurd choice between two equally unhelpful documentation strategies, both of which admit ignorance while trying to protect the fragile working state."
  rating: 7

- text: "Clean code is like a garden. Mine's more of a compost heap that somehow still grows vegetables."
  explanation: "This uses an extended metaphor comparing code quality to gardening. The self-deprecating humor acknowledges that while the code isn't well-maintained or pretty, it's still functional—creating an incongruous image of success through messiness."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to refactor? He said, 'If it ain't broke, don't understand it.'"
  explanation: "This twists the familiar saying 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' to highlight a common problem in software development: avoiding code improvement because the existing code is too complex to understand. The humor lies in the admission that incomprehensibility has become an excuse for inaction."

- text: "I write self-documenting code. Unfortunately, it documents my confusion."
  explanation: "Self-documenting code is a software craftsmanship ideal where code is so clear it needs no comments. This joke subverts that ideal by suggesting the code clearly expresses something, just not clarity—creating humor through the gap between aspiration and reality."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between code that works and clean code? About three weeks and a manager asking why you're still working on it."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the tension between functional code and well-crafted code, pointing out the real-world constraint of time pressure. The humor comes from the uncomfortable truth that business priorities often conflict with craftsmanship ideals."
  rating: 8

- text: "My variable names are so descriptive, they're practically novellas. My functions? Still named 'doStuff'."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the contradiction between over-engineering one aspect of code quality (variable names) while completely neglecting another (function names). The absurd imbalance reveals inconsistent attention to coding standards."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't programmers like cleaning their code? Because every time they do, they find out how it actually works."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the fear that refactoring will reveal the code was working by accident rather than design. The humor lies in the paradox that improving code quality might expose its fundamental fragility."
  rating: 9

- text: "I follow the DRY principle religiously. Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't Repeat Yourself."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that violates the very principle it claims to follow. The repetition of 'Don't Repeat Yourself' creates immediate ironic humor that any programmer will recognize, using the structure to embody the punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code review comment: 'This is brilliant!' Translation: 'I have no idea what this does, but I'm afraid to ask.'"
  explanation: "This exposes the social dynamics of code reviews where reviewers sometimes hide their confusion behind praise. The humor comes from revealing the gap between professional communication and honest understanding."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a program with no bugs? Unfinished."
  explanation: "A concise joke that subverts expectations about software quality. Instead of 'perfect' being the answer, it suggests that bug-free code simply hasn't been tested enough yet—a cynical but relatable perspective on software development reality."
  rating: 10

- text: "My code is so maintainable, I've been maintaining it for three years and still don't understand it."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the paradox of claiming maintainability while describing the opposite experience. The time investment makes the lack of understanding even more absurd, highlighting how complexity can persist despite ongoing effort."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the clean code evangelist get fired? He spent six months refactoring the company's Hello World example."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration to satirize over-zealous pursuit of code quality at the expense of practical business value. The absurdity of spending months on the simplest possible program creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always write comments, but when I do, they say 'TODO: Add comment here'."
  explanation: "A self-referential joke that uses the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format. The humor comes from the meta-nature of a comment acknowledging its own absence, creating a recursive loop of procrastination."
  rating: 8

- text: "Technical debt is just future me's problem. Unfortunately, I keep running into that guy."
  explanation: "This personifies the consequence of poor code quality decisions, creating humor through the realization that 'future me' is actually just present-day suffering. The casual dismissal colliding with inevitable accountability makes it relatable."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of debt? The technical kind—because unlike financial debt, you can pretend it doesn't exist until the system crashes."
  explanation: "This joke compares technical debt to financial debt, highlighting how technical debt is often invisible to management and can be ignored longer. The dark humor comes from the inevitable catastrophic failure that forces acknowledgment."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code has more layers than an onion. And like an onion, working with it makes people cry."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor starts with the positive architectural concept of layered design but subverts it by focusing on the emotional response. The unexpected connection between onions and code quality creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the software architect bring a ladder to the code review? Someone said the code quality was at an all-time low, and he wanted to see how far down it went."
  explanation: "This uses physical comedy imagery applied to abstract concepts. The literalization of 'low code quality' into something requiring a ladder creates absurdist humor while commenting on truly terrible code."
  rating: 6

- text: "I practice extreme programming. Extremely poor programming."
  explanation: "A concise wordplay joke that subverts the technical term 'Extreme Programming' (an Agile methodology) by reinterpreting 'extreme' as an intensifier for poor quality. The brevity and unexpected twist make it punchy."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call code that's been copy-pasted fifteen times with slight modifications? A design pattern. What do you call it after the sixteenth time? A job security strategy."
  explanation: "This joke has a two-part structure that first ironically justifies bad practice as intentional design, then escalates to suggesting it's deliberately creating complexity to ensure continued employment. The cynical progression creates layered humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote such elegant code yesterday that today I can't figure out what I was thinking. It's like abstract art—beautiful until someone asks what it means."
  explanation: "This creates humor by comparing code to abstract art, suggesting that excessive cleverness leads to incomprehensibility. The joke acknowledges the paradox that overly elegant solutions can be worse than straightforward ones, and that even the author becomes confused."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do clean code advocates make terrible archaeologists? Because when they find ancient artifacts, their first instinct is to refactor them into modern standards, destroying all historical context in the process. 'This perfectly preserved Roman aqueduct could really benefit from microservices architecture.'"
  explanation: "This extended metaphor joke creates an absurd scenario where software craftsmanship principles are applied to physical archaeology. The humor builds through the increasingly ridiculous image of someone wanting to 'modernize' ancient structures, paralleling the sometimes misguided impulse to refactor working legacy code. The specific example of applying microservices to a Roman aqueduct is deliberately absurd, highlighting how context-inappropriate some refactoring efforts can be."
