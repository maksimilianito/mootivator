- text: "My hard drive crashed. At least it was consistent—it failed at everything."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity by applying the concept of 'consistency' (usually a positive trait) to complete failure, creating an absurd silver lining to hardware failure."

- text: "Why did the RAM stick go to therapy? It couldn't handle the pressure."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on the double meaning of 'handle' and 'pressure'—both technical terms for memory management and emotional stress, using the setup-punchline structure."

- text: "My motherboard died. I guess it couldn't handle being a single parent to all those components."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the motherboard, creating humor through the incongruity of applying family dynamics to computer hardware relationships."

- text: "The GPU overheated and quit. Apparently, it was tired of being so graphic about its problems."
  explanation: "A wordplay joke exploiting the double meaning of 'graphic'—both relating to visual processing and to explicit/detailed descriptions."

- text: "Why don't hard drives ever win at poker? Because they always crash when the stakes are high."
  explanation: "This combines the technical term 'crash' with the gambling metaphor, creating humor through the unexpected application of hardware failure to a card game scenario."

- text: "My power supply failed during a storm. It just couldn't conduct itself properly."
  explanation: "A pun on 'conduct' referring to both electrical conductivity and behavioral propriety, using misdirection to create the humorous twist."

- text: "I asked my failing SSD how it was feeling. It said, 'I'm having an existential crisis—I can't remember who I am anymore.'"
  explanation: "This personifies storage failure as memory loss and identity crisis, creating humor through the parallel between data corruption and human psychological conditions."

- text: "Why did the CPU break up with the cooling fan? Their relationship had too many hot and cold moments."
  explanation: "Uses the technical relationship between CPU and cooling system as a metaphor for an unstable romantic relationship, with 'hot and cold' working on both literal and figurative levels."

- text: "My computer's blue screen said 'FATAL ERROR.' I didn't know it was being dramatic—I thought it was just Windows being Windows."
  explanation: "This plays with the incongruity between the serious-sounding 'FATAL ERROR' message and the commonplace nature of Windows crashes, using superiority theory through shared frustration."

- text: "The hard drive made clicking sounds before it died. Turns out it was trying to communicate in Morse code: 'H-E-L-P M-E.'"
  explanation: "Creates absurdist humor by imagining the 'click of death' as an intentional distress signal, anthropomorphizing hardware failure in an exaggerated way."

- text: "Why did the RAID array go to couples counseling? Because its mirrors weren't reflecting each other's feelings anymore."
  explanation: "A sophisticated technical joke playing on RAID mirroring terminology and relationship therapy language, working on multiple levels for technical audiences."

- text: "My graphics card artifacts looked like modern art. I tried selling them as NFTs before the card completely died."
  explanation: "This joke combines hardware failure (GPU artifacts) with contemporary culture (NFTs), creating humor through the absurd attempt to monetize malfunction as art."

- text: "A technician walks into a data center. Three servers are on fire. He checks his ticket: 'Priority: Low.' He walks back out."
  explanation: "A story-format joke using absurdist humor and relief theory to comment on IT ticketing systems' disconnect from reality, with perfect comedic timing in the walkout."

- text: "Why don't capacitors ever tell the truth? Because they're always storing up lies, and eventually they leak."
  explanation: "A clever double-meaning joke where capacitor failure (bulging and leaking) parallels dishonest behavior, with 'storing' working for both electricity and deception."

- text: "My motherboard had a short circuit. I told it to stop taking shortcuts in life, but it just sparked an argument."
  explanation: "Multiple layers of wordplay with 'short circuit,' 'shortcuts,' and 'sparked,' creating a cohesive narrative of anthropomorphized hardware giving life advice."

- text: "The system administrator's five stages of hardware grief: Denial ('It's just sleeping'), Anger ('WHY NOW?!'), Bargaining ('Please boot just one more time'), Depression ('All my data...'), and Acceptance ('Well, at least I have backups... wait, do I?')"
  explanation: "A sophisticated structural joke that parodies the Kübler-Ross model while perfectly capturing the emotional journey of hardware failure, with a dark twist ending."

- text: "Why did the hard drive go to the gym? To work on its physical sectors. It died anyway—turns out you can't exercise away bad blocks."
  explanation: "This joke uses technical terminology (physical sectors, bad blocks) as double meanings for fitness concepts, with a darkly humorous twist that subverts the expected positive outcome."

- text: "My server's last words before kernel panic were: 'I'm not feeling very stable.' I should have listened—it had been sending warning signs for weeks. Classic case of ignoring red flags in a toxic relationship."
  explanation: "Sophisticated humor that parallels system monitoring warnings with relationship warning signs, using the relief theory to cope with the common IT experience of ignoring alerts until disaster strikes."

- text: "Three engineers are debugging a hardware failure. The electrical engineer says, 'It's a power issue.' The mechanical engineer says, 'It's a cooling problem.' The software engineer says, 'Have we tried turning it off and on again?' The hardware was dead. The software engineer was promoted to management."
  explanation: "A layered joke that plays with engineering stereotypes, the classic IT solution, and corporate absurdity, with the punchline delivering unexpected commentary on management selection criteria."

- text: "My RAID controller failed and took all six drives with it. The error message said, 'Redundancy is futile.' I think my server achieved sentience just to mock me before dying."
  explanation: "This combines technical failure (RAID controller death), science fiction references (Borg 'resistance is futile'), and dark humor about the irony of redundancy systems failing catastrophically, with perfect absurdist escalation."

- text: "A quantum computer's hard drive fails. The technician asks, 'Is the data recoverable?' The physicist replies, 'Yes and no—until we try to recover it, the data exists in a superposition of both perfectly intact and completely corrupted. But the moment we attempt recovery, the wave function collapses and...' The technician interrupts: 'So you're saying it's Schrödinger's backup?' The physicist nods. They both stare at the dead drive. The data was never backed up. It is now definitely dead."
  explanation: "The most sophisticated joke in the set, combining quantum mechanics concepts with hardware failure, building through technical explanation to a wordplay punchline, then subverting everything with a dark twist that comments on backup negligence—a masterclass in layered humor structure with perfect timing and escalation."
