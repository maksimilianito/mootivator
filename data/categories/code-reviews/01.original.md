- text: "Code reviews: where everyone's an expert on your code, but their own is 'still a work in progress.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory, highlighting the ironic behavior where developers are quick to critique others' code but hesitate to apply the same standards to their own work. The humor comes from the recognition of this universal double standard in software development."

- text: "Why do code reviewers make terrible comedians? Their feedback is always too constructive."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'constructive criticism' - a hallmark of good code reviews - but suggests that comedy requires more destructive or edgy humor. The incongruity lies in applying professional standards to an incompatible domain."

- text: "My code review came back with 47 comments. Apparently 'it works on my machine' isn't sufficient documentation."
  explanation: "This joke combines the infamous programmer excuse with the reality of thorough code reviews. The humor stems from the deflation of the developer's confidence and the mismatch between minimal effort and professional expectations."

- text: "Code review status: 'Looks good to me' translated means 'I scrolled past it.'"
  explanation: "This exposes the gap between the formal approval process and actual review depth, using the relief theory to acknowledge a common shortcut that many developers recognize but rarely admit to taking."

- text: "I asked for a code review. Got back a philosophical treatise on variable naming conventions."
  explanation: "The humor comes from the exaggerated response where a simple request escalates into an overly academic discussion, reflecting how code reviews can sometimes focus on minor details rather than substantive issues."

- text: "Why did the developer cry during code review? Someone suggested renaming his variables from 'x' and 'y.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the emotional attachment developers have to their code and the pain of receiving criticism, even when it's valid. The absurdity of crying over variable names creates the comedic effect."

- text: "Code reviews are like family dinners: everyone has opinions, someone always brings up the past, and you leave feeling judged."
  explanation: "This uses analogy humor to compare the social dynamics of code reviews to family gatherings, highlighting the emotional and interpersonal aspects that transcend the technical nature of the work."

- text: "In code reviews, 'minor suggestion' means 'rewrite everything before I approve this.'"
  explanation: "The misdirection pattern is used here, where the gentle language of 'minor suggestion' conceals the actual scope of work required, reflecting the sometimes passive-aggressive nature of review feedback."

- text: "My pull request has been open for three weeks. I'm starting to think 'awaiting review' is just a polite way of saying 'forgotten.'"
  explanation: "This joke addresses the common frustration of delayed reviews using the relief theory, allowing developers to laugh at a shared pain point in the development process."

- text: "Why don't developers like code reviews? Because 'diff' is just one letter away from 'difficult.'"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke that connects the technical term 'diff' (showing code differences) with the emotional experience of having your code scrutinized, using phonetic similarity for humor."

- text: "Code reviewer's paradox: If you find no issues, you didn't look hard enough. If you find too many, you're being nitpicky."
  explanation: "This presents a genuine logical paradox that code reviewers face, using the absurdity of the no-win situation to create humor while acknowledging a real professional dilemma."

- text: "I wrote 'TODO: fix this later' in my code. Reviewer wrote 'TODO: fix this now' in his comment. Touch√©."
  explanation: "The humor comes from the reviewer turning the developer's own procrastination tactic against them, creating a moment of witty comeuppance that both parties can appreciate."

- text: "Code review drinking game: take a shot every time someone says 'this could be more readable.' You'll be drunk by lunch."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the frequency of a common review comment to absurd levels, using hyperbole to highlight how certain phrases become meaningless through overuse."

- text: "Why did the code review take six hours? Because someone discovered a single-character typo in line 847 and it spiraled into a debate about the Oxford comma."
  explanation: "This showcases how code reviews can derail into tangential discussions, using the absurdity of debating grammar rules in programming to illustrate scope creep in review processes."

- text: "My code reviewer approved my PR with 'LGTM.' Later found out it stands for 'Let's Get This Merged' not 'Looks Good To Me.' Explains a lot about production."
  explanation: "A clever reinterpretation of a common acronym that suggests reviewers are sometimes more focused on completing the process than ensuring quality, with humorous consequences."

- text: "Code review stages: 1) Confidence. 2) First comment arrives. 3) Existential crisis. 4) Acceptance. 5) Rename variables."
  explanation: "This parodies the five stages of grief, applying them to the emotional journey of receiving code review feedback, creating humor through the recognition of this universal developer experience."

- text: "Senior dev's code review: 'Consider refactoring.' Junior dev's translation: 'Your code is an abomination and I'm questioning your career choices.'"
  explanation: "This exposes the gap between diplomatic professional language and the potential harsh reality beneath, using the superiority theory and the mentor-mentee dynamic for comedic effect."

- text: "I finally got approved after 47 review iterations. The last change? Adding a period to a comment. I've learned that punctuation is mightier than the sword."
  explanation: "The absurdity of extensive revisions culminating in a trivial change creates humor while commenting on the sometimes excessive perfectionism in code review culture."

- text: "Code review haiku: Your logic is sound / But have you considered / Using a switch case?"
  explanation: "This meta-joke combines the formal structure of haiku poetry with typical code review feedback, creating humor through the juxtaposition of artistic form and technical critique."

- text: "Why did the developer implement a recursive function to handle code review comments? Because each fix generated exactly two new comments, perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines recursion concepts, the Fibonacci-like growth of review comments, and a pop culture reference to create layered humor about the seemingly endless nature of review cycles."

- text: "My code reviewer left 200 comments, then marked it 'approved with suggestions.' That's not suggestions, that's a manifesto. I'm not merging code, I'm negotiating a peace treaty."
  explanation: "This is the crescendo joke using escalating hyperbole and multiple analogies (manifesto, peace treaty) to capture the overwhelming experience of extensive code reviews, while the contradiction of 'approved with suggestions' for 200 comments creates perfect comedic incongruity."
