- text: "My SQL query returned 0 rows. Guess it's not my type."
  explanation: "A play on database queries returning empty result sets and the dating phrase 'not my type,' creating a double meaning about both database results and romantic rejection."

- text: "Why did the database administrator stay calm during the outage? He had good table manners."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'table' - both database tables and dining etiquette, suggesting composure in stressful situations."

- text: "I tried to query my database about its feelings. It said NULL."
  explanation: "Plays on the SQL NULL value representing absence of data, applied humorously to emotions, suggesting the database has no feelings to report."

- text: "What's a database's favorite type of music? Table Rock."
  explanation: "Combines 'table' from database terminology with 'Table Rock' as a play on music genres, creating an absurd but fitting musical preference for databases."

- text: "My query optimizer went to therapy. Turns out it had too many inner conflicts."
  explanation: "Uses 'INNER' from SQL INNER JOIN operations as a pun on 'inner conflicts' from psychology, suggesting the optimizer has personal issues with its join strategies."

- text: "Why don't databases ever win at poker? They always show their indexes."
  explanation: "References database indexes while playing on the poker phrase 'show your hand,' suggesting databases can't bluff because their indexing strategies are visible."

- text: "I asked my database for relationship advice. It said 'It's complicated' and drew me an ER diagram."
  explanation: "Plays on Entity-Relationship diagrams used in database design and the Facebook relationship status 'It's complicated,' suggesting databases understand complex relationships literally."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables and asks, 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "Classic setup using the SQL JOIN operation in a social context, where the query literally wants to join two database tables as if they were people at a bar."

- text: "Why did the SELECT statement break up with WHERE? It felt too restricted."
  explanation: "Personifies SQL clauses, where the WHERE clause filters/restricts results, creating a relationship metaphor about feeling constrained."

- text: "My database has commitment issues. Every time I try to INSERT, it just rolls back."
  explanation: "Uses SQL transaction concepts (INSERT and ROLLBACK) to describe relationship commitment problems, where the database refuses to permanently store the relationship."

- text: "What did the frustrated developer say? 'My queries are so slow, I've started timing them with a calendar instead of a stopwatch.'"
  explanation: "Exaggerates query performance issues to absurd levels, suggesting queries take days or months instead of milliseconds, highlighting the frustration of poorly optimized databases."

- text: "I wrote a query so complex, even the execution plan needed a flowchart to understand itself."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about SQL execution plans becoming so complicated they need their own visualization, playing on the recursive absurdity of documentation needing documentation."

- text: "Why did the DBA go broke? He kept spending all his time optimizing queries but forgot to index his savings."
  explanation: "Plays on database indexing for performance with financial 'indexing' of savings, suggesting the DBA was so focused on work optimization they neglected personal finance optimization."

- text: "My LEFT JOIN walked into a bar. The bartender asked, 'Where's your friend?' It replied, 'They're optional.'"
  explanation: "Perfectly captures the essence of LEFT JOIN operations, which return all records from the left table even if there's no match in the right table, making the 'friend' optional."

- text: "I tried to teach my database about emotions. Now every query returns 'It's not you, it's my foreign key constraints.'"
  explanation: "Combines relationship breakup language with foreign key constraints that restrict database operations, suggesting the database blames technical limitations for emotional unavailability."

- text: "Why did the database go to the gym? To work on its physical schema and improve its table definition."
  explanation: "Puns on 'physical schema' (database structure) and physical fitness, while 'table definition' works as both database design and having defined/toned abs."

- text: "A developer's spouse asked, 'Do you love me or your database more?' He replied, 'SELECT * FROM priorities WHERE love = TRUE ORDER BY importance DESC LIMIT 1;' She filed for divorce."
  explanation: "Humorously shows a developer trying to answer an emotional question with a SQL query, demonstrating the stereotype of programmers over-engineering simple responses and the consequences of poor communication."

- text: "My database and I got into an argument. I said, 'You're being inconsistent!' It replied, 'Actually, I'm ACID compliant, so technically I'm very consistent.'"
  explanation: "Clever use of ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) where the database defends itself using technical accuracy about consistency guarantees against emotional accusations."

- text: "Why did the query cross the road? To JOIN the other table. But it was a CROSS JOIN, so it ended up everywhere."
  explanation: "Subverts the classic 'why did the chicken cross the road' joke with SQL JOIN types, where CROSS JOIN creates a Cartesian product, meaning the query didn't just cross the road but appeared at every possible location."

- text: "I told my database, 'We need to talk about our relationship.' It responded, 'DROP TABLE relationship; CREATE TABLE relationship_new; -- Let's start fresh with better constraints.'"
  explanation: "Perfectly captures how a database would handle relationship problems: by dropping and recreating with improved design, showing the absurdity of applying database solutions to human problems."

- text: "A junior developer spent three days writing a query with seventeen nested subqueries. A senior developer looked at it and said, 'You know there's a WITH clause, right?' The junior developer stared blankly and whispered, 'WITH... what?' The senior developer sighed, 'Exactly.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke highlights the learning curve in SQL, where Common Table Expressions (WITH clause) can simplify complex queries, while also punning on the junior's confused response 'with what' echoing the SQL keyword 'WITH'."
