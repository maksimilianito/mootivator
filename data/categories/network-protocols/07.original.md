- text: "UDP walks into a bar. The bartender doesn't acknowledge it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on UDP's connectionless nature - unlike TCP, UDP doesn't wait for acknowledgment of received packets. The bartender not acknowledging UDP mirrors how UDP protocol doesn't require confirmation that data was received."

- text: "Why did HTTP break up with HTTPS? Too much overhead in the relationship."
  explanation: "HTTPS adds encryption overhead compared to plain HTTP. The joke uses relationship terminology to describe the technical difference, where 'overhead' refers both to computational cost and emotional baggage."

- text: "TCP and UDP had a race. TCP won because UDP didn't care if it finished."
  explanation: "This contrasts TCP's reliable, ordered delivery with UDP's 'fire and forget' approach. UDP prioritizes speed over guaranteed delivery, so it metaphorically doesn't care about completing the race properly."

- text: "An IPv4 address walks into a bar and says, 'I'm running out of space.' IPv6 replies, 'I have room for everyone in the universe.'"
  explanation: "This references the IPv4 address exhaustion problem (only 4.3 billion addresses) versus IPv6's virtually unlimited address space (340 undecillion addresses)."

- text: "Why don't network engineers tell secrets? Because packets have no privacy without encryption."
  explanation: "A straightforward joke about network security - unencrypted packets can be intercepted and read by anyone on the network path, making them terrible for keeping secrets."

- text: "ICMP walks into a bar. 'Destination unreachable,' says the bartender."
  explanation: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is famous for its error messages, particularly 'Destination Unreachable.' The bartender's response is literally an ICMP error message rejecting the connection."

- text: "A packet walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'We don't serve your type here.' The packet replies, 'But I'm connectionless!'"
  explanation: "This plays on both social discrimination and the technical distinction between connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) protocols, with the packet defending itself using protocol terminology."

- text: "Why did the DNS server go to therapy? It had too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "A pun on DNS's job of 'resolving' domain names to IP addresses. When DNS fails, it creates 'unresolved' queries, which doubles as psychological terminology for personal problems."

- text: "FTP walks into a secure building. Security says, 'Sorry, you're not authenticated.' SFTP walks in right behind and gets waved through."
  explanation: "FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sends credentials in plain text, while SFTP uses SSH for secure authentication. This contrasts their security approaches through a physical security metaphor."

- text: "What's a network protocol's favorite dance? The three-way handshake."
  explanation: "TCP establishes connections using a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK). The joke treats this technical process as if it were an actual dance move."

- text: "A SYN packet walks into a bar. The bartender says 'SYN-ACK.' The packet never responds. The bartender waits forever."
  explanation: "This describes a SYN flood attack where the third part of TCP's handshake never completes, leaving the server with half-open connections. The bartender waiting forever represents resource exhaustion."

- text: "Why did the router break up with the switch? It said, 'You never know where to forward our relationship.'"
  explanation: "Routers make forwarding decisions based on IP addresses (Layer 3), while switches work with MAC addresses (Layer 2). The joke personifies their different networking functions as relationship incompatibility."

- text: "HTTP goes to a job interview. The interviewer asks, 'What's your state?' HTTP replies, 'I'm stateless.' The interviewer says, 'That's going to be a problem.'"
  explanation: "HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning it doesn't retain information between requests. This technical limitation is framed as a personal flaw in a job interview scenario."

- text: "A broadcast packet walks into a bar and starts talking to everyone at once. The bartender yells, 'One conversation at a time!' The multicast packet smirks from the corner booth."
  explanation: "This contrasts broadcast (sends to everyone) with multicast (sends to interested parties). The multicast packet's smugness comes from being more efficient and selective than broadcast."

- text: "Why don't TCP packets ever get lost? Because they always ask for directions and confirm they arrived."
  explanation: "TCP's reliability comes from acknowledgments and retransmissions. The joke anthropomorphizes these mechanisms as someone who's careful about navigation and always confirms their arrival."

- text: "An ARP request walks into every room in the building shouting, 'WHO HAS THIS IP ADDRESS?' One device quietly responds, 'That's me, here's my MAC address.' Everyone else rolls their eyes."
  explanation: "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) broadcasts to all devices on a network to find which MAC address corresponds to an IP. The eye-rolling represents the inefficiency of broadcast traffic."

- text: "SMTP, POP3, and IMAP walk into a bar. SMTP says, 'I'm just here to deliver.' POP3 says, 'I'm taking everything and leaving.' IMAP says, 'I'm staying to manage things properly.'"
  explanation: "This captures the different email protocols' behaviors: SMTP delivers mail, POP3 downloads and typically deletes from server, while IMAP synchronizes and manages mail on the server."

- text: "A ping packet walks into a bar and immediately walks out. It comes back and tells everyone, 'The bar exists and it took me 20ms to verify.'"
  explanation: "Ping uses ICMP Echo Request/Reply to test connectivity and measure round-trip time. The packet's behavior perfectly mirrors what ping actually does - quick verification and latency measurement."

- text: "Why did the SSL certificate go to the doctor? It was about to expire and needed renewal. The doctor said, 'I can't help you, but the Certificate Authority can.'"
  explanation: "SSL/TLS certificates have expiration dates and must be renewed through Certificate Authorities. The joke treats certificate expiration as a medical condition requiring specialized care."

- text: "A TCP packet walks into a bar, orders a beer, waits for acknowledgment, receives it, then drinks the beer, sends a FIN, waits for acknowledgment, receives it, and leaves. A UDP packet walks in, yells 'BEER!' at the bartender, and immediately leaves. The bartender shrugs and pours it anyway, not knowing if anyone will drink it."
  explanation: "This elaborately contrasts TCP's reliable, connection-oriented approach with UDP's unreliable, connectionless method. TCP's careful process ensures delivery; UDP's chaos prioritizes speed over certainty."

- text: "BGP walks into a bar and announces, 'I know the best path to every other bar in the world!' Another BGP router says, 'Really? Because I heard from three other routers that you're lying.' The first BGP thinks for 30 seconds and updates its entire worldview."
  explanation: "BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routes internet traffic between autonomous systems by sharing path information. The joke captures BGP's gossip-like behavior, slow convergence, and how it trusts information from peers, making it vulnerable to misinformation - a critical real-world security concern."
