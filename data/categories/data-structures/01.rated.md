- text: "My linked list is feeling lonely—it keeps looking for its next connection."
  explanation: "This joke personifies a linked list data structure, playing on the double meaning of 'connection' as both a social relationship and the technical 'next' pointer that links nodes together."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the array go to therapy? It had too many issues with its index."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure, creating incongruity by applying human psychological problems to a data structure, while 'index' works as both a technical term and suggesting problems with organization."
  rating: 5

- text: "A stack walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Sorry, you'll have to wait—I serve in LIFO order.'"
  explanation: "This joke applies the Last-In-First-Out principle of stacks to a social situation, creating humor through the unexpected application of a technical concept to everyday life."
  rating: 7

- text: "My hash table and I broke up. There were just too many collisions."
  explanation: "Uses relationship metaphor with the technical concept of hash collisions, where multiple keys map to the same bucket, creating a double meaning about conflicts in relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't binary trees ever win arguments? They're always going off on tangents."
  explanation: "Plays on the visual structure of binary trees with their branches, connecting it to the idiom of 'going off on tangents' in conversations."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my queue to be patient. It said, 'I've been waiting in line this whole time!'"
  explanation: "Personifies a queue data structure, using the double meaning of 'queue' as both a data structure and a waiting line, with the punchline reinforcing the FIFO nature."

- text: "What's a graph's favorite social media platform? LinkedIn, obviously."
  explanation: "Creates humor through the connection between graph data structures (which consist of linked nodes) and the professional networking site LinkedIn, suggesting graphs would naturally prefer a platform about connections."
  rating: 8

- text: "My circular buffer is so optimistic—it believes every ending is just a new beginning."
  explanation: "Applies philosophical thinking to the technical property of circular buffers that wrap around, creating incongruity between data structure behavior and human emotional perspectives."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the heap refuse to organize? It preferred a more relaxed structure."
  explanation: "Plays on the partially-ordered nature of heap data structures versus fully sorted structures, using 'relaxed' as both a personality trait and a technical description."
  rating: 6

- text: "A programmer's spouse asked, 'Why do you keep talking about trees?' He replied, 'Because my family tree is actually a directed acyclic graph.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection—starting with what seems like a complaint about work-life balance, then delivers a punchline about complex family relationships being better represented as a DAG than a traditional tree."
  rating: 9

- text: "What did the balanced tree say to the unbalanced one? 'You really need to get your life sorted.'"
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes trees while using 'balanced' and 'sorted' as both life advice and technical properties, creating layered meaning about tree optimization."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to explain linked lists to my friend. The conversation just kept going in circles—turns out I was describing a circular linked list."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that uses the structure of the joke itself to mirror the technical concept being discussed, with the circular nature applying to both the conversation and the data structure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why are arrays so confident at parties? They know their position in life."
  explanation: "Uses the technical property of arrays having indexed positions to create a joke about self-confidence and knowing one's place, with 'position' working on multiple levels."
  rating: 6

- text: "A deque walks into a bar from both doors simultaneously. The bartender says, 'Make up your mind!' The deque replies, 'I don't have to—I'm double-ended.'"
  explanation: "This joke cleverly uses the defining characteristic of a deque (double-ended queue) to create a physical comedy scenario, with the punchline being both literal and technical."
  rating: 8

- text: "My trie told me it's feeling underappreciated. I said, 'Don't worry, I value every prefix of your being.'"
  explanation: "Sophisticated wordplay on the trie data structure's purpose (prefix matching) combined with emotional support language, creating humor through the application of technical precision to feelings."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the graph go to the psychiatrist? It had too many cycles and couldn't find closure."
  explanation: "Brilliant double meaning using 'cycles' (loops in graphs) and 'closure' (both psychological resolution and graph theory concept), creating layered technical and emotional humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "A skip list walks into a job interview. 'What's your biggest strength?' 'I know how to take shortcuts while maintaining integrity.'"
  explanation: "Uses the skip list's actual optimization strategy (shortcuts through levels) as a job interview answer, creating humor through the unexpected application of technical advantages to professional situations."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a binary search tree and my life? The BST eventually finds what it's looking for in O(log n) time."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that contrasts the efficiency of binary search trees with human struggles, using Big O notation to quantify the joke's technical accuracy while maintaining relatable emotional content."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my B-tree for advice. It said, 'Sometimes you need to split before you can grow.' Then it rebalanced itself and walked away."
  explanation: "Profound life advice that perfectly mirrors the actual behavior of B-trees during insertion operations, creating humor through the absurd image of a data structure being a wise mentor."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't hash tables believe in fate? They think everything is just a matter of good distribution."
  explanation: "Philosophical humor that connects hash table performance (dependent on hash function distribution) with determinism versus fate, creating a surprisingly deep technical joke about free will."
  rating: 8

- text: "A red-black tree walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Why so serious?' It replies, 'I have to maintain strict balance in my life. One wrong rotation and everything falls apart. Also, I'm constantly worried about my color identity—am I red enough? Too black? And don't even get me started on my uncle issues during rebalancing.' The bartender pours it a double and says, 'Sounds like you need to AVL yourself of some therapy.'"
  explanation: "This elaborate joke layers multiple concepts: red-black tree properties (color rules, rotation operations, the 'uncle' node in rebalancing algorithms), combines them with genuine anxiety metaphors, and ends with a pun on AVL trees (another self-balancing tree type). It's technically dense while maintaining emotional authenticity, creating humor through the absurdity of a data structure having an existential crisis about its defining properties."
