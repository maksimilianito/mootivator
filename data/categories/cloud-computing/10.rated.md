- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer, but with better marketing."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the demystification of cloud computing by reducing it to its fundamental truth - remote servers owned by others - while acknowledging the industry's success in branding this concept as something more sophisticated."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the startup move to the cloud? Because they couldn't afford the ground floor."
  explanation: "This uses a double meaning of 'cloud' and real estate terminology, creating incongruity between physical and digital infrastructure while commenting on startups' budget constraints."
  rating: 7

- text: "I put all my data in the cloud. Now I'm just waiting for it to rain information."
  explanation: "This joke extends the cloud metaphor literally, creating absurdity by treating digital cloud storage as if it were an actual weather system."
  rating: 5

- text: "What's a cloud engineer's favorite type of music? Heavy metal servers."
  explanation: "This combines the physical reality of server hardware (metal) with music genres, creating a pun that acknowledges the tangible infrastructure behind cloud abstraction."
  rating: 6

- text: "My company switched to cloud computing. Now when things crash, they fall from a much greater height."
  explanation: "This plays with the cloud metaphor to describe system failures, using the vertical dimension to humorously suggest that cloud failures are somehow more dramatic than traditional ones."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't clouds ever get lost? They always know their IP address."
  explanation: "This personifies clouds while making a pun on 'address' - both a physical location and a network identifier, creating a simple but effective double meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "I asked the cloud for storage space. It gave me 5GB and a lecture about virtualization."
  explanation: "This personifies cloud services as pedantic, reflecting the experience of dealing with cloud platforms that come with complexity and technical requirements beyond simple storage."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a cloud that's always down? Fog."
  explanation: "This uses meteorological terminology to describe service outages, with 'fog' representing a cloud that has descended (failed), creating a clever visual and technical metaphor."

- text: "My boss said we're moving everything to the cloud. I asked which one - cumulus or stratus? He wasn't amused."
  explanation: "This creates humor through deliberate misunderstanding, applying meteorological cloud types to IT infrastructure, highlighting the sometimes pretentious nature of tech terminology."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the database break up with the cloud? Too much latency in their relationship."
  explanation: "This applies technical terminology (latency/delay) to romantic relationships, creating a parallel between network performance issues and relationship problems."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to touch the cloud. My finger went right through the screen and now I need a new monitor."
  explanation: "This creates absurdist humor by taking the cloud metaphor literally, resulting in a physical action that bridges the digital-physical divide in an impossible way."

- text: "What's the difference between the cloud and a magician? The magician tells you it's magic. The cloud makes you figure it out yourself."
  explanation: "This joke comments on cloud computing's complexity and lack of transparency, comparing it unfavorably to magic shows which at least admit they're creating illusions."
  rating: 8

- text: "A sysadmin walks into a cloud. He never came back - turns out he forgot his VPN credentials."
  explanation: "This creates a narrative joke where the cloud becomes a physical space you can get trapped in, playing on the real frustration of access control and authentication."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do cloud services make terrible comedians? Their delivery is always distributed."
  explanation: "This uses 'distributed' in both its technical sense (distributed computing) and comedic sense (joke delivery), creating a sophisticated double meaning about cloud architecture."
  rating: 8

- text: "I stored my backup in the cloud and my primary on-premises. Now I have two points of failure and twice the anxiety."
  explanation: "This subverts the expectation that redundancy creates reliability, instead highlighting how hybrid cloud strategies can multiply concerns rather than resolve them."
  rating: 9

- text: "What did the on-premises server say to the cloud? 'You may be scalable, but at least I know where I sleep at night.'"
  explanation: "This personifies infrastructure in a conversation that touches on the philosophical question of data sovereignty and the comfort of physical control versus cloud abstraction."
  rating: 8

- text: "My company achieved 99.9% uptime in the cloud. The 0.1% was during the investor demo."
  explanation: "This uses Murphy's Law humor, where the timing of failures is perfectly inconvenient, reflecting the real experience where cloud reliability statistics never account for critical moments."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to trust the cloud? He had commitment issues with anything he couldn't physically unplug."
  explanation: "This applies psychological relationship terminology to IT infrastructure decisions, creating humor from the control issues some IT professionals have with cloud services."
  rating: 7

- text: "I explained cloud computing to my grandmother. She asked if that's why her photos keep disappearing. I had no good answer."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the collision of technical abstraction with user experience, where the cloud metaphor actually makes technology less understandable and the expert is rendered helpless."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a cloud provider's favorite excuse? 'It's not down, it's just experiencing atmospheric pressure.'"
  explanation: "This brilliantly extends the weather metaphor to create corporate euphemisms for outages, satirizing how service providers use technical language to obscure problems while maintaining the cloud analogy."
  rating: 9

- text: "They said the cloud would make everything easier. Now I need three certifications, two authentication methods, and a PhD just to store a cat photo."
  explanation: "This joke builds to an absurd climax by contrasting the simplicity of the task (storing a cat photo) with the Byzantine complexity of modern cloud security and architecture, capturing the irony that 'easier' solutions often create more complexity."
