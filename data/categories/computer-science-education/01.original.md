- text: "My CS professor said we'd learn to think like computers. Now I can't decide what to eat without a flowchart."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity of applying computational thinking to everyday decisions, highlighting how CS education can influence students' thought processes in humorous ways. It's a gentle observation about the side effects of learning computer science."

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to class? Because the course was about high-level programming languages!"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke using the double meaning of 'high-level' - both as a physical height and as a programming concept. This setup-punchline structure uses misdirection to create humor through the unexpected literal interpretation."

- text: "Our data structures professor is so old, he taught linked lists using actual chains."
  explanation: "This superiority theory joke plays on the age of professors and the evolution of teaching methods, creating humor through exaggeration while poking fun at traditional teaching approaches in a lighthearted way."

- text: "CS degree requirements: 120 credits, 4 years, and the ability to explain to your parents what you actually do."
  explanation: "This joke uses the pattern of listing requirements but adds an unexpected social element at the end. It reflects the real frustration CS students face when their field is misunderstood by non-technical family members."

- text: "My algorithms class had a steep learning curve. Specifically, O(n²)."
  explanation: "A technical joke that applies Big O notation to describe the difficulty of learning itself. This works on multiple levels - both as a metaphor and as a demonstration of understanding computational complexity."

- text: "Why don't CS students ever finish their homework on time? They're still waiting for their code to compile from last semester."
  explanation: "This exaggeration joke plays on the common frustration of long compilation times, using temporal absurdity to highlight a real pain point in the CS learning experience."

- text: "Our university offers a minor in debugging. It's basically a major with fewer features."
  explanation: "This meta-humor applies software terminology ('minor' vs 'major' and 'features') to academic programs, creating a layered joke that works both as wordplay and as commentary on academic program structure."

- text: "Studied recursion today. To understand it, I had to study recursion today. To understand it, I had to study recursion today."
  explanation: "A self-demonstrating joke that embodies the concept it's describing. This recursive structure creates humor through the frustration many students feel when first encountering recursive thinking."

- text: "My CS education taught me two things: how to code, and that I should have learned to code before taking CS classes."
  explanation: "This paradoxical observation highlights the catch-22 many CS students experience - feeling like they need to already know programming to learn programming effectively. It uses irony to comment on curriculum design."

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include philosophy? So students could ponder 'What is code?' while debugging at 3 AM."
  explanation: "This joke combines the existential nature of philosophy with the practical reality of late-night debugging sessions, creating humor through the juxtaposition of abstract thinking and concrete frustration."

- text: "Our operating systems course had a practical exam: keep Windows running for 24 hours without restarting."
  explanation: "A joke that plays with the concept of 'practical exams' by suggesting an impossible task, using the stereotype of Windows instability to create absurdist humor about OS education."

- text: "CS education: where 'Hello World' takes 10 minutes, and your final project takes 10 weeks to print 'Goodbye World.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses temporal contrast and progression to highlight the gap between beginner expectations and advanced reality, with an ironic twist that the complex project does something equally simple."

- text: "My compiler design professor was so strict, even his syllabus had syntax errors."
  explanation: "A self-referential joke that applies programming concepts to real-world documents, creating humor through the irony of a compiler expert making the very mistakes they teach students to avoid."

- text: "Why do CS students make terrible historians? They think everything before Git didn't have version control."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the limited perspective that comes from CS education, using Git as a cultural touchstone while commenting on how modern tools can make students forget about the history of computing."

- text: "Our machine learning course was so advanced, even the professor didn't understand the final exam answers. The neural network graded itself."
  explanation: "An absurdist joke that extends the concept of machine learning to its logical extreme, while also commenting on the 'black box' nature of some ML systems and the complexity of advanced CS topics."

- text: "I asked my CS advisor about work-life balance. She said, 'That's a deprecated concept. Try work-work balance instead.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses programming terminology ('deprecated') while satirizing the notorious work culture in tech education and industry, creating humor through the bleak but relatable observation."

- text: "Why did the CS department install a revolving door? So students could experience continuous integration in real life."
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke that connects physical architecture with DevOps practices, using the double meaning of 'continuous integration' to comment on both student retention and modern development practices."

- text: "Our CS curriculum is so comprehensive, we learn 17 programming languages. Unfortunately, the job market only uses the 18th."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the perpetual challenge of CS education staying current with industry needs, using specific numbers to create absurdist humor about the gap between academia and practice."

- text: "Theory class: 'Assume we have infinite memory.' Lab class: 'Your program crashed. You allocated 2GB.'"
  explanation: "A brilliant contrast joke that exposes the gap between theoretical CS education and practical constraints, using the setup-punchline structure to deliver commentary on the disconnect between theory and practice."

- text: "My CS degree came with a certificate of completion and a lifetime subscription to Stack Overflow Premium. Just kidding—Stack Overflow doesn't have Premium, and neither does my degree."
  explanation: "A multi-layered meta-joke that builds up expectations, subverts them, and then delivers a self-deprecating punchline about the perceived value of CS degrees while acknowledging the reality of constant learning."

- text: "Why did the CS graduate refuse to attend their own graduation? They were still debugging their thesis. It's been three years. They're now a professor there, still debugging. The thesis achieved sentience and is now on the faculty committee."
  explanation: "An escalating absurdist narrative that starts with a relatable situation and spirals into complete chaos, using the concept of perpetual debugging to create increasingly ridiculous scenarios that comment on academic perfectionism and the never-ending nature of software development."
