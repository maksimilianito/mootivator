- text: "Code reviews: where 'LGTM' means 'I scrolled past it.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common code review acronym 'LGTM' (Looks Good To Me), suggesting reviewers often approve code without thoroughly examining it, just by scrolling through."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers fear code reviews? Because comments come back to haunt them."
  explanation: "This uses a double meaning of 'comments' - both code comments and reviewer feedback - while playing on the phrase 'come back to haunt' to describe the anxiety of receiving critical feedback."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code review feedback was so gentle, I got reported to HR for being sarcastic."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the paradox that overly polite or gentle feedback in code reviews can actually come across as passive-aggressive or sarcastic, especially in the blunt culture of programming."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code review status: 'Approved with 47 comments.' So... approved?"
  explanation: "This captures the contradiction between formally approving code while simultaneously leaving dozens of critical comments, questioning what 'approval' really means."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always write perfect code, but when I do, it's right before a code review gets cancelled."
  explanation: "This plays on Murphy's Law and the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format, suggesting that developers only produce their best work when no one will be there to witness or validate it."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the junior developer bring a shield to the code review? He heard it was a 'defensive programming' session."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the double meaning of 'defensive programming' - both the coding practice of anticipating errors and the literal defensive posture one might take when receiving criticism."
  rating: 6

- text: "Code reviews are like family dinners: everyone has opinions, someone's feelings get hurt, and we all pretend it was productive."
  explanation: "This comparison uses the familiar social dynamics of family gatherings to illustrate the often uncomfortable and contentious nature of code reviews, with a touch of self-aware cynicism."
  rating: 9

- text: "My reviewer said my code was 'interesting.' I'm updating my resume."
  explanation: "This joke relies on understanding that 'interesting' in professional contexts is often a polite euphemism for 'problematic' or 'concerning,' making it a career-threatening assessment."
  rating: 8

- text: "In code reviews, 'Why did you do it this way?' is never actually a question."
  explanation: "This highlights how rhetorical questions in code reviews are really masked criticism, with the reviewer already knowing they disagree with the approach."
  rating: 9

- text: "I spent 3 hours writing code and 3 days defending it in review. Efficiency!"
  explanation: "This uses ironic humor to point out the often disproportionate time spent justifying code decisions versus actually writing the code, questioning the process's efficiency."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code review drinking game: take a shot every time someone says 'this could be refactored.' You'll be dead by lunch."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the frequency of refactoring suggestions in code reviews to absurd, lethal levels, highlighting how this particular feedback is almost universal and sometimes overused."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't code reviewers ever get lost? They always find something to nitpick about the path you took."
  explanation: "This uses the metaphor of navigation to describe how reviewers will critique any approach, no matter how correct, by finding minor issues with implementation details."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code passed review! The reviewer must have been on vacation."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke suggests that the only way code could pass without criticism is if no actual review took place, playing on developer insecurity and review thoroughness."
  rating: 6

- text: "Code review feedback: 'Can you explain this?' Translation: 'I don't understand this, but I'm making it your problem.'"
  explanation: "This exposes the dynamic where reviewers shift the burden of unclear code back to the author, even when the reviewer's own understanding might be the issue."
  rating: 8

- text: "I love how 'optional' suggestions in code reviews become mandatory when they come from the senior dev."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the power dynamics in code reviews where seniority transforms suggestions into requirements, regardless of how they're phrased."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code reviews: where 'this is fine' and 'this is a dumpster fire' are separated by one semicolon placement."
  explanation: "This exaggerates how reviewers can have extreme reactions to minor formatting or style issues, elevating trivial details to critical problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "My favorite part of code reviews is when someone suggests the exact approach I tried first before spending 6 hours finding a workaround for why it doesn't work."
  explanation: "This captures the frustrating experience of receiving 'helpful' suggestions that ignore the complex problem-solving journey and constraints the developer already navigated."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer automate code reviews? Because humans kept approving code that worked."
  explanation: "This paradoxical joke plays on the tension between functional code and 'perfect' code, suggesting that human reviewers are too lenient while automated tools enforce arbitrary standards."
  rating: 7

- text: "Code review best practice: submit your PR at 4:59 PM Friday. By Monday, everyone will be too confused to remember what they were going to criticize."
  explanation: "This uses strategic timing humor to suggest a way to game the review system, playing on how context and memory fade over weekends, resulting in less thorough reviews."
  rating: 8

- text: "Senior dev's code review: 'Looks good.' Junior dev's identical code: 'Have you considered rewriting this in assembly for better performance?'"
  explanation: "This satirizes the double standards in code reviews where identical code receives vastly different feedback based solely on who wrote it, highlighting bias and power dynamics."
  rating: 10

- text: "I proposed we review our code review process. Now I'm in an infinite loop of meta-reviews reviewing the reviews of the review process. Send help, or at least a base case."
  explanation: "This creates humor through recursion and programming logic, where attempting to improve the review process creates a self-referential loop that mirrors actual recursive programming problems, complete with a plea for the terminating condition."
