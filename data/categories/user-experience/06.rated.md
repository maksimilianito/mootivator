- text: "UX Designer's motto: 'The user is always right... until they tell you what they want.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the classic customer service saying 'the customer is always right' but adds the twist that in UX design, users often can't articulate what they actually need, highlighting the gap between user requests and good design."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the UX designer use a ladder? To reach the drop-down menu."
  explanation: "This is a literal interpretation of the term 'drop-down menu' - a common UI element. The absurdity comes from treating a digital interface element as if it were a physical object."

- text: "A user walks into a bar. The UX designer asks, 'How was the door?'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights how UX designers obsess over every tiny interaction point in an experience, even the most mundane ones that others wouldn't think twice about."
  rating: 8

- text: "User testing revealed our app is intuitive. We just had to explain it to users for 45 minutes first."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony - if something truly intuitive, it shouldn't require extensive explanation. It mocks the disconnect between designers' intentions and actual user experience."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't UX designers like nature? Too many edge cases with the trees."
  explanation: "This applies the technical term 'edge cases' (unusual scenarios that need special handling) to the natural world, creating humor through the absurd application of UX thinking to everything."
  rating: 6

- text: "I asked users what color they wanted the button. Three hours later, I'm still in the meeting."
  explanation: "This reflects the reality that asking users for design input often leads to endless debates and opinions, making the design process more complicated rather than simpler."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our app has a 100% success rate! We just don't count the users who gave up."
  explanation: "This joke uses survivorship bias - only measuring successful users while ignoring those who failed. It satirizes how metrics can be manipulated to look good."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the user call tech support? The interface was too intuitive and they didn't trust it."
  explanation: "This creates humor through paradox - users are so accustomed to complicated interfaces that a simple one seems suspicious or wrong, inverting the usual UX problem."
  rating: 7

- text: "We made the font bigger, the buttons larger, and the colors brighter. Grandma still printed out the website."
  explanation: "This illustrates the futility of trying to solve fundamental user behavior through interface design alone, highlighting the gap between digital solutions and user mental models."
  rating: 8

- text: "User feedback: 'I love it! But can you make it completely different?'"
  explanation: "This captures the contradictory nature of user feedback, where users express satisfaction but then request changes that would fundamentally alter what they claim to love."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do UX designers make terrible magicians? They always reveal how the trick works before performing it."
  explanation: "UX designers prioritize transparency and clarity, which is opposite to magicians who rely on mystery. This highlights the UX principle of making systems understandable."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our A/B test showed users prefer option A. Management chose option C."
  explanation: "This joke reflects the frustration when data-driven UX decisions are overridden by subjective management preferences, a common pain point in the field."
  rating: 9

- text: "I designed a perfect interface. Then I watched a user try to use it."
  explanation: "This captures the humbling moment when designers realize their 'perfect' design doesn't match actual user behavior, emphasizing the importance of user testing."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the user click the logo 47 times? They were looking for the home button we clearly labeled 'HOME' right next to it."
  explanation: "This highlights the pattern where users follow learned behaviors (clicking logos to go home) even when explicit alternatives exist, showing how conventions trump clarity."
  rating: 8

- text: "We removed the feature nobody used. Now we're getting emails from the three people who used it daily asking why we hate them personally."
  explanation: "This illustrates the challenge of data-driven design decisions and how even tiny user segments can be very vocal, making designers feel guilty for rational choices."
  rating: 9

- text: "User: 'This is so confusing!' Designer: 'But you're doing it correctly right now.' User: 'Still confusing!'"
  explanation: "This paradox shows how perceived usability differs from actual usability - users can successfully complete tasks while still feeling the interface is poor, highlighting the emotional aspect of UX."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't end users read error messages? The same reason UX designers don't read user feedback - there's too much of it and most of it hurts."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke creates symmetry between users and designers, suggesting both groups avoid information that challenges them, with a meta-commentary on the UX profession itself."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent six months perfecting the onboarding flow. Users skip it in six seconds."
  explanation: "This captures the tragicomic reality of UX work where enormous effort goes into features users bypass, highlighting the gap between designer investment and user behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many users does it take to test an interface? Just one, but you'll need to watch 50 to believe what the first one did."
  explanation: "This plays on the 'how many does it take' joke format while expressing the truth that user behavior is so varied and unexpected that designers need multiple observations to accept what they're seeing."
  rating: 7

- text: "We achieved perfect accessibility compliance! Now nobody can figure out how to use it, equally."
  explanation: "This joke uses dark irony to highlight how focusing too rigidly on technical accessibility standards might create interfaces that are equally confusing for everyone, missing the spirit of accessible design."
  rating: 6

- text: "A UX designer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says 'Welcome!' The designer responds, 'Thanks, but the gate needs better affordances, the clouds have contrast issues, and have you considered a progressive disclosure pattern for the halos? Also, I noticed you're not mobile-responsive - what about users who die on their phones?'"
  explanation: "This joke shows how UX designers can't turn off their critical analysis of interfaces, even in paradise. It humorously suggests that the UX mindset becomes so ingrained that designers critique everything, even divine experiences, touching on multiple UX concepts while showing the obsessive nature of the profession."
