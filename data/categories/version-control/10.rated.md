- text: "I tried to commit my changes, but Git said I had conflicts. Turns out my code disagreed with itself."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'conflicts' - both the technical Git merge conflicts and the philosophical idea of code being self-contradictory. It's a simple observational humor about a common Git experience."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer always use Git blame? Because accepting responsibility wasn't in his commit history."
  explanation: "This uses the Git command 'blame' (which shows who last modified each line) as a metaphor for avoiding personal accountability. The punchline connects technical tools with human behavior patterns."
  rating: 8

- text: "SVN users don't have trust issues. They just prefer centralized control over their relationships."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts SVN's centralized architecture with Git's distributed model, anthropomorphizing the version control choice as a personality trait about control and trust."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code review came back with 'Looks good to me.' I'm keeping that commit forever as proof I once did something right."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke reflects the rarity of receiving unqualified approval in code reviews, treating it as a precious achievement worth preserving in version history."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a version control system's favorite exercise? Push-ups."
  explanation: "A simple pun on the Git command 'push' combined with the physical exercise. It's wordplay that requires basic Git knowledge."
  rating: 4

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. That's why God invented git revert."
  explanation: "This plays on the 'most interesting man' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of testing in production and using Git's revert command as a safety net for mistakes."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer had 1 problem. He decided to use branches. Now he has merge conflicts."
  explanation: "This riffs on the classic 'now you have two problems' joke format, replacing the punchline with the actual consequence of branching - merge conflicts being even more complex than the original issue."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Git repository go to therapy? Too many unresolved conflicts."
  explanation: "This personifies a Git repository with psychological problems, where technical 'conflicts' mirror emotional ones. The therapy metaphor suggests these conflicts need professional help to resolve."
  rating: 6

- text: "I've been on this feature branch so long, master has evolved into a different species."
  explanation: "This uses evolutionary biology as a metaphor for divergent codebases. Long-lived feature branches can become so outdated that the main branch is unrecognizable, like separate evolutionary paths."
  rating: 9

- text: "My git log reads like a diary: 'Fixed thing', 'Actually fixed thing', 'Fixed the fix', 'Why did I even become a developer'."
  explanation: "This highlights the emotional journey captured in commit messages, showing the progression from confidence to despair that many developers experience, immortalized forever in version history."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call a Git user who never pushes? A hoarder."
  explanation: "This joke labels developers who keep commits locally without sharing them as hoarders, playing on the psychological condition while highlighting poor collaboration practices."
  rating: 5

- text: "I tried to explain Git to my manager using a tree analogy. Now he wants me to branch out more and stop cherry-picking tasks."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the manager misunderstanding Git terminology (branch, cherry-pick) as career advice, showing how technical metaphors can backfire when taken literally."
  rating: 8

- text: "In a parallel universe, there's a version of me who understood Git rebase on the first try. I'm still trying to merge with him."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses Git concepts (parallel branches, merging) to describe alternate realities, with the irony that even understanding this joke requires the Git knowledge the speaker claims to lack."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't version control systems ever win arguments? Because they always have to commit to both sides of the story."
  explanation: "This plays on 'commit' as both a Git command and the act of dedicating oneself to a position, suggesting version control systems are non-judgmental record-keepers of all perspectives."
  rating: 7

- text: "A senior developer's .gitignore file is just a list of all their past mistakes."
  explanation: "This suggests that experienced developers know exactly what problems to avoid (ignore) based on historical failures, turning a technical file into a metaphor for learned wisdom."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked Git for a clean history. It gave me git rebase -i. I asked for a lawyer."
  explanation: "This treats interactive rebase (a powerful but dangerous history-rewriting tool) as something so legally questionable it requires legal counsel, exaggerating its capacity for causing problems."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between Git and a time machine? A time machine doesn't make you resolve conflicts with your past self."
  explanation: "This elevates Git to time-travel technology while pointing out that unlike fictional time machines, Git forces you to reconcile different versions of your work, creating paradoxes you must manually resolve."
  rating: 9

- text: "My team switched from SVN to Git. Now instead of one source of truth, we have distributed lies."
  explanation: "This darkly humorous take on distributed version control suggests that decentralization just means errors and misinformation are now replicated everywhere, inverting Git's supposed advantages."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally understand Git: it's a directed acyclic graph of my poor life choices, with each commit being a node of regret and every merge a reminder that I should have rebased."
  explanation: "This technically accurate description of Git's data structure becomes an existential meditation on regret, treating the entire version history as a monument to accumulated mistakes and missed opportunities."
  rating: 10

- text: "A junior dev, a senior dev, and Git walk into a bar. The junior commits everything. The senior amends and force pushes. Git just sits there, faithfully recording both of their terrible decisions."
  explanation: "This three-character joke format shows the evolution of Git usage from naive over-committing to reckless history rewriting, with Git itself as the neutral observer documenting all mistakes for posterity."
  rating: 9

- text: "They say those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That's why I use git bisect to find exactly which commit doomed me, so I can repeat it with full awareness."
  explanation: "This subverts the famous historical quote by using git bisect (a tool for finding problematic commits) not to avoid mistakes but to repeat them consciously, suggesting a nihilistic acceptance of inevitable failure in programming."
