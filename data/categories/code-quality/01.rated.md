- text: "My code is so clean, it passed the health inspection."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'clean' - both clean code (well-written, maintainable) and literal cleanliness. The unexpected application of a health inspection (typically for restaurants) to code creates incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always write maintainable code, but when I do, I make sure nobody else can read it either."
  explanation: "This is a paradoxical joke that subverts the concept of maintainability. The humor comes from the contradiction - maintainable code should be readable, but the speaker ensures it's unreadable, defeating the purpose entirely."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to comment his code? He believed in 'self-documenting' mysteries."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'self-documenting code' (code that's clear without comments) by adding 'mysteries,' which contradicts the entire concept. The incongruity between self-documenting and mysterious creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "My variable names are so descriptive, they come with their own table of contents."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration to poke fun at overly verbose variable naming. The absurdity of variable names being so long they need a table of contents highlights the tension between clarity and brevity."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's the difference between code quality and a unicorn? At least people believe unicorns might exist."
  explanation: "This joke uses superiority theory and exaggeration to suggest that good code quality is even rarer than mythical creatures, reflecting the common frustration with encountering poorly written code."
  rating: 8

- text: "I practice extreme programming. Extremely bad programming."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection by setting up an expectation about the Extreme Programming methodology, then subverting it with a self-deprecating twist about code quality."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do software craftsmen use so many design patterns? Because one pattern isn't enough to hide the mess underneath."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through cynicism about over-engineering, suggesting that multiple design patterns are used not for good architecture but to obscure poor code quality."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code review comments are so polite, they come with trigger warnings for the harsh truth."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the tension between politeness in professional communication and the need for honest feedback about code quality, using modern cultural references to trigger warnings for comedic effect."
  rating: 5

- text: "How many developers does it take to write clean code? Nobody knows, the experiment is still running."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic 'how many X does it take' format to suggest that achieving clean code is an impossible or never-ending task, reflecting real frustrations with code quality."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my junior developer to write SOLID code. He made it rock hard to understand."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on SOLID (software design principles) and the physical meaning of solid, suggesting that following principles without understanding them can make code harder, not easier, to work with."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call a function that does exactly one thing? Unemployed - it got replaced by a function that does everything."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes the violation of the Single Responsibility Principle by suggesting that focused functions are replaced by bloated ones, inverting the ideal of software craftsmanship."
  rating: 8

- text: "My codebase is like fine wine. It gets worse with age and gives everyone a headache."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the common metaphor of code aging like wine (improving), instead suggesting it deteriorates, which reflects the reality of unmaintained legacy code."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the code smell so bad? Because someone kept passing gas parameters."
  explanation: "This joke combines the technical term 'code smell' (indicators of poor quality) with toilet humor about 'gas' and 'passing parameters,' creating a juvenile but effective double meaning."
  rating: 5

- text: "A developer walks into a bar. The bar was set so low, he didn't even notice."
  explanation: "This joke uses the metaphor of 'setting the bar low' (low standards) combined with the physical setup of walking into a bar, creating humor about poor code quality standards."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code is so well-refactored, even I don't recognize it anymore. Wait, that might be a problem."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through self-awareness, suggesting that over-refactoring can make code unrecognizable even to its author, which defeats the purpose of maintainability."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of debt? Technical debt - it's the only kind they can create faster than they can pay off."
  explanation: "This joke plays on financial debt metaphors applied to code quality, highlighting how technical debt accumulates rapidly in real projects, often faster than teams can address it."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my colleague why his code had so many nested if statements. He said he was building a pyramid scheme."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay combining the visual structure of deeply nested conditionals (pyramid-like) with the concept of pyramid schemes, suggesting the code is both structurally problematic and ethically questionable."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't developers trust their own code? Because they know who wrote it."
  explanation: "This is a self-deprecating joke that plays on the universal programmer experience of returning to one's own code and wondering what they were thinking, highlighting the gap between intentions and execution."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code follows the DRY principle religiously: Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't Repeat Yourself."
  explanation: "This is an ironic joke that demonstrates the violation of the DRY principle while claiming to follow it, using repetition for comedic effect to highlight the gap between stated principles and actual practice."
  rating: 10

- text: "A manager asked for 'production-ready code.' The developer shipped his laptop to the client."
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdist literalism to highlight the ambiguity in requirements. The humor comes from taking 'production-ready' to its extreme literal interpretation - code that only works in its original production environment."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the code reviewer approve the pull request? He figured future him could deal with it. Future him is now present him, and he's very angry at past him."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through the time-travel-like nature of technical debt, where developers defer problems to their future selves, creating a cycle of frustration. The personification of past, present, and future selves adds to the comedic effect while highlighting the real consequences of compromising on code quality."
