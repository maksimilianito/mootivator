- text: "I entered a coding competition. Turns out 'Hello World' wasn't enough to win."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the beginner's first program being insufficient for competitive programming, highlighting the gap between basic tutorials and actual algorithmic challenges."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the programmer fail the puzzle competition? He kept trying to brute force the solution instead of thinking outside the box."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'brute force' - both a legitimate algorithmic approach and a metaphor for lacking creativity in problem-solving."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code passed all test cases except the edge cases. Apparently, the edge cases were the entire competition."
  explanation: "This reflects the common frustration where edge cases, often overlooked in practice, become the determining factor in competitive programming."
  rating: 8

- text: "I optimized my algorithm from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). I went from last place to second-to-last place."
  explanation: "This joke highlights how even significant algorithmic improvements might not be enough when competing against highly optimized solutions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Coding competition rule #1: If your solution works, it's probably too slow. If it's fast enough, it probably doesn't work."
  explanation: "This captures the classic trade-off dilemma in competitive programming between correctness and efficiency, presented as an impossible paradox."
  rating: 9

- text: "I spent three hours debugging my solution. Turns out I was solving the wrong problem. At least my code was perfect!"
  explanation: "This plays on the irony of technical perfection being worthless when applied to the wrong problem - a common mishap in timed competitions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do competitive programmers love binary search? Because they're always looking for the middle ground between giving up and trying everything."
  explanation: "This creates a metaphorical connection between the binary search algorithm and the psychological state of competitive problem-solving."
  rating: 7

- text: "My dynamic programming solution had so many dimensions, I needed a physics degree to visualize it."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the complexity of multi-dimensional DP solutions, comparing them to theoretical physics concepts."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally solved the hardest problem in the competition! Then I realized I'd spent five hours and the contest ended four hours ago."
  explanation: "This captures the tunnel vision programmers experience when deeply engaged in a problem, losing track of practical constraints like time limits."
  rating: 8

- text: "Competitive programming: where 'almost correct' and 'completely wrong' are the same thing."
  explanation: "This highlights the binary nature of automated judging systems - there's no partial credit for being close to the right answer."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer bring a whiteboard to the coding competition? Because sometimes the best algorithm is the one you never implement."
  explanation: "This plays on the irony that planning can be more valuable than coding, but in competitions, only implemented solutions count."
  rating: 6

- text: "I thought I was clever using recursion. The stack overflow thought otherwise."
  explanation: "This is a concise joke about the common pitfall of recursive solutions exceeding memory limits in competitive programming."
  rating: 7

- text: "My greedy algorithm worked perfectly on the sample inputs. The judge's test cases were apparently less generous."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay with 'greedy' and 'generous' while highlighting how greedy algorithms often fail on hidden test cases despite working on examples."
  rating: 8

- text: "I joined a 24-hour coding marathon. At hour 3, I realized I'd been debugging a semicolon. At hour 4, I found another one."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the frustration of syntax errors consuming valuable time in high-pressure competitions, with the punchline suggesting it's a recurring nightmare."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do algorithmic puzzles make terrible dinner conversations? Because nobody wants to hear about your O(n log n) sorting solution when they asked how your day was."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the social awkwardness of technical obsession, showing the disconnect between competitive programmers and normal social contexts."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a perfect solution in pseudocode. Then spent the entire competition translating it to actual code. Turns out pseudocode doesn't compile."
  explanation: "This plays on the gap between algorithmic thinking and implementation, with the absurd punchline stating the obvious in a deadpan way."
  rating: 6

- text: "Coding competitions taught me that there are three types of solutions: the one that works, the one that's fast, and the one you actually have time to write."
  explanation: "This is a variation on the classic engineering triangle, adapted specifically to the time-pressure reality of competitive programming."
  rating: 9

- text: "My backtracking solution explored every possible path. Including the ones that led to my computer freezing and my hopes dying."
  explanation: "This personifies the algorithm's exhaustive search as a metaphorical journey that ends in both technical and emotional failure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the programmer disqualified from the competition? He tried to import the 'solution' library. Apparently, that one doesn't exist."
  explanation: "This plays on the wishful thinking that there could be a magic library that solves algorithmic problems, contrasting with the reality that you must implement everything yourself."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally understood the problem statement at the five-minute warning. My code understood it never."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the parallel structure showing two levels of failure - late comprehension and complete implementation failure - with the grammatically awkward 'understood it never' adding to the comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "Competitive programming is just LeetCode with anxiety, time pressure, and the crushing realization that someone solved in 3 minutes what took you 3 hours. And their solution is somehow shorter than your variable names."
  explanation: "This builds layers of escalating frustration, ending with an absurd comparison that emphasizes the humbling nature of seeing elegant solutions after struggling with verbose ones. The multi-layered structure creates a crescendo of relatable pain points that culminates in a perfectly specific punchline."
