- text: "Our documentation is always up to date—it just documents last year's version."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and incongruity. The phrase 'up to date' typically means current, but the punchline reveals it's actually outdated by a year. This reflects the common reality in software development where documentation lags behind code changes, creating a humorous contradiction between the claim and reality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer write documentation? His manager was watching."
  explanation: "This employs the superiority theory through self-deprecating humor about developers' reluctance to document their work. The joke suggests documentation only happens under external pressure, not as a natural practice, which resonates with the stereotype that programmers prefer coding to writing docs."
  rating: 6

- text: "The best comment is the code itself—said every developer who never had to maintain their own code six months later."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection and delayed realization. It starts with a common developer mantra about self-documenting code, then undermines it by pointing out the reality that even your own undocumented code becomes incomprehensible over time. The temporal element (six months) adds specificity that makes the situation more relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our API documentation has three states: nonexistent, outdated, and 'see the source code.'"
  explanation: "This joke employs the rule of three pattern, with escalating absurdity. Each state is progressively worse than simply having no documentation, with the final state being particularly ironic since telling users to read source code defeats the entire purpose of API documentation."
  rating: 8

- text: "I spent three hours debugging before I read the documentation. The documentation was wrong, so technically I saved time."
  explanation: "This uses logical paradox and rationalization humor. The developer's reasoning is absurd—they didn't save time—but the conclusion follows a twisted logic that programmers use to justify their documentation-avoidance habits. It also touches on the frustration of incorrect documentation being worse than no documentation."

- text: "What's the difference between a fairy tale and a software manual? A fairy tale starts with 'Once upon a time...' while a software manual starts with 'This is easy...'"
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses parallel structure and incongruity. Both are implied to be fiction, but the punchline suggests documentation's false promises about ease of use are the real fantasy. It plays on the common experience of documentation claiming something is simple when it's actually complex."
  rating: 9

- text: "Documentation is like sex: when it's good, it's very good, and when it's bad, it's still better than nothing."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses a risqué but work-appropriate analogy to express a universal truth about documentation quality. The structure builds from high expectations to pragmatic acceptance, reflecting how developers feel about documentation—even poor documentation provides some value."
  rating: 7

- text: "A developer writes documentation in the same way a vampire enters a church—reluctantly and only when absolutely necessary."
  explanation: "This metaphorical comparison uses vivid imagery to capture the developer's aversion to documentation. The vampire metaphor suggests documentation is fundamentally against a developer's nature, creating humor through exaggerated characterization while remaining relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't developers trust documentation? Because the last time they did, they spent two days implementing a feature that was deprecated three versions ago."
  explanation: "This setup-punchline joke explains developer cynicism through a specific, painful scenario. The humor comes from the wasted effort and the irony that following documentation led to more problems than ignoring it would have. The specificity ('two days,' 'three versions') makes it more concrete and funny."
  rating: 8

- text: "README.md: 'TODO: Add documentation.' Last updated: 4 years ago."
  explanation: "This minimalist joke uses the format of actual file metadata to create humor. The irony is that the only documentation is a note promising future documentation that never came. The four-year timestamp emphasizes the permanence of this neglect, making the procrastination comically extreme."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code is self-documenting. Unfortunately, it's written in a dialect of gibberish only I understood yesterday."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the 'self-documenting code' trope by acknowledging that even the author loses comprehension rapidly. The temporal specificity ('yesterday') and the term 'dialect of gibberish' create humor through absurd precision about code incomprehensibility."
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know a developer actually wrote documentation? The commit message says 'Added docs' and the diff shows they changed a typo in a comment from three years ago."
  explanation: "This joke uses the gap between claim and reality. The commit message promises substantial documentation, but the actual change is trivial and barely qualifies. It satirizes the minimal effort developers put into documentation while still wanting credit for it."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our documentation follows agile principles: it's iterative, adaptive, and perpetually in sprint zero."
  explanation: "This joke appropriates agile methodology terminology to describe documentation failure. 'Sprint zero' is the planning phase before real work begins, so documentation being perpetually there means it never actually gets written. The humor comes from using positive-sounding methodology language to describe complete inaction."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation once. Then I woke up, and my code was still a mystery wrapped in an enigma, commented in ancient Sumerian."
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'it was all a dream' trope combined with escalating absurdity. The reference to Churchill's famous quote about Russia ('mystery wrapped in an enigma') elevated by the ridiculous 'ancient Sumerian' detail creates layers of humor about code incomprehensibility."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a developer's favorite type of documentation? The kind written by someone else, about someone else's code, that they'll never have to maintain."
  explanation: "This joke uses the rule of three with escalating conditions that remove all responsibility. Each clause adds another layer of distance from actual documentation work, revealing developers' preference to consume rather than create documentation, and only when they're not accountable for the code."
  rating: 7

- text: "My documentation strategy is revolutionary: I write variable names so long that reading the code feels like reading a novel. A very boring, repetitive novel with no plot."
  explanation: "This joke starts with false bravado about a 'revolutionary' approach, then deflates it by acknowledging the result is terrible. The extended metaphor comparing code to a bad novel creates humor through the absurd comparison, while the qualifiers 'boring' and 'repetitive' make it self-aware."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the API documentation go to therapy? It had an identity crisis—half of it described version 2.0, the other half version 3.5, and nobody knew which endpoints actually existed."
  explanation: "This personification joke gives documentation human psychological problems that mirror real technical issues. The specific version numbers and the concrete problem (unknown endpoints) ground the absurd premise in real frustration developers experience with inconsistent documentation."
  rating: 7

- text: "They say good documentation is worth its weight in gold. That's why all our documentation is digital and technically weighs nothing—we're very cost-conscious."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on the idiom 'worth its weight in gold' by taking the weight aspect literally. The logical conclusion is absurd but follows perfectly from the premise, creating humor through false economic reasoning that justifies having no documentation."
  rating: 8

- text: "I found a bug in the documentation today. The bug was that the documentation existed, giving users false hope that it might be accurate."
  explanation: "This meta-joke redefines what constitutes a 'bug' in documentation. The twist is that the problem isn't content errors but the existence of documentation itself, which creates expectations that will inevitably be disappointed. It's darkly humorous about documentation quality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our documentation team consists of one developer who lost a bet, a technical writer who's never seen the code, and an intern who thinks API stands for 'A Pretty Illustration.' Together, they form the Avengers of Ambiguity."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through character-based comedy with three incompetent archetypes. Each member is unqualified in a different, specific way, and the superhero team reference ('Avengers') contrasts hilariously with their actual product ('Ambiguity'). The alliteration in the final phrase adds punch."
  rating: 9

- text: "The documentation says 'For more information, see the documentation.' I've been clicking that link for three hours now. I think I've achieved documentation enlightenment—the realization that there is no information, only references to information, infinitely recursing into the void of human knowledge."
  explanation: "This joke starts with a simple circular reference problem and escalates into mock-philosophical territory. The progression from frustration to false enlightenment parodies both bad documentation and pretentious philosophy. The phrase 'infinitely recursing into the void' combines technical and existential language for maximum absurdity, making it the perfect culmination of documentation humor."
