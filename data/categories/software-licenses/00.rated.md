- text: "I chose GPL because it was free."
  explanation: "A play on the word 'free' - GPL (General Public License) is free as in 'freedom' (libre), but the joke character misunderstands it as free as in 'no cost' (gratis), highlighting a common confusion about open source licensing."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer read the EULA? He didn't."
  explanation: "An anti-joke that plays on the universal truth that almost nobody reads End User License Agreements, despite technically agreeing to them. The setup creates expectation for a punchline, but delivers reality instead."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code is so open source, even I don't know what license it has."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about poor documentation practices, where developers forget to include proper licensing information in their projects, ironically defeating the purpose of open source clarity."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's the difference between proprietary software and a black box? The black box has better documentation."
  explanation: "A jab at proprietary software's tendency to be opaque and poorly documented, comparing it unfavorably to literal black boxes, which at least have flight data recorders with some information."
  rating: 8

- text: "I released my code under the 'Good Luck With That' license."
  explanation: "A humorous reference to abandonware and unsupported code, creating a fictional license that captures the essence of code released with no warranties or support - a parody of actual disclaimer clauses."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't programmers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, just like license agreements."
  explanation: "A double-layer joke combining the classic science pun with a commentary on how license agreements seem to contain endless, often incomprehensible terms that 'make up' legal obligations."
  rating: 5

- text: "My software is licensed under Creative Commons: Creative Cursing and Common Crashes."
  explanation: "A wordplay on the well-known Creative Commons license, reinterpreting the abbreviation to reflect the reality of buggy software and frustrated developers."

- text: "I wanted to use MIT license, but I couldn't afford the tuition."
  explanation: "Playing on MIT being both a prestigious expensive university and one of the most permissive free software licenses, creating an absurd incongruity between the two meanings."
  rating: 9

- text: "Apache license is great - it serves up permissions like a web server serves up pages."
  explanation: "A pun connecting the Apache Software License with the Apache web server, using the metaphor of 'serving' to link both meanings while highlighting the license's permissive nature."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer choose BSD license? He wanted his code to be free, not free*."
  explanation: "References the philosophical difference between BSD (permissive) and GPL (copyleft) licenses, where BSD offers fewer restrictions, contrasting 'truly free' with 'free with conditions' (the asterisk suggesting fine print)."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to fork a project, but the license said 'No outside food or drink.'"
  explanation: "An absurd mixing of software forking terminology with restaurant policies, creating humor through the ridiculous application of physical world rules to digital code repositories."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code is open source, but my willingness to maintain it is proprietary."
  explanation: "A cynical but relatable joke about open source burnout, where the code is freely available but the developer's time and energy are not, inverting the usual open/closed dichotomy."
  rating: 10

- text: "What do you call a GPL violation? A copyleft hook!"
  explanation: "A boxing pun playing on 'copyleft' (the GPL's approach) and 'left hook' (boxing move), suggesting GPL violations will result in a legal punch, referencing the FSF's enforcement actions."
  rating: 7

- text: "I read the Oracle license agreement. Now I need a lawyer, a therapist, and possibly an exorcist."
  explanation: "Exaggerated commentary on Oracle's notoriously complex and aggressive licensing terms, suggesting they're not just confusing and stressful, but potentially supernaturally evil."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the startup use AGPL? They wanted to ensure their competitors would stay away, too."
  explanation: "A strategic joke about how AGPL (Affero GPL) is considered 'viral' and avoided by many companies, so using it becomes a competitive moat rather than just a licensing choice."
  rating: 8

- text: "My software license is like my dating profile: full of restrictions nobody reads until it's too late."
  explanation: "A relatable comparison using the setup-comparison structure, highlighting how both licenses and dating profiles contain important information that people ignore until problems arise."
  rating: 8

- text: "I dual-licensed my project under GPL and 'Please Hire Me.' The second one gets more clicks."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about open source developers hoping their projects will lead to job opportunities, suggesting the real 'license' they care about is employment."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer get confused at the restaurant? The menu said 'fork this' but didn't specify a license."
  explanation: "Playing with 'fork' as both a utensil and a Git operation, creating absurdity by expecting real-world objects to have software licenses, highlighting how deeply programming concepts pervade developer thinking."
  rating: 6

- text: "I chose the Unlicense for my code because if I don't own it, I can't be blamed for it. Checkmate, lawyers."
  explanation: "A humorous misunderstanding of the Unlicense (which dedicates code to public domain), treating it as a legal shield against responsibility rather than understanding its actual purpose of maximizing freedom."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a lawyer's favorite open source license? Whichever one is being violated right now."
  explanation: "A cynical joke about legal professionals profiting from license disputes, suggesting lawyers prefer conflict over clarity, with the timing element ('right now') adding urgency and opportunism to the humor."

  explanation: "References the real WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License) while creating a absurd corporate sanitization scenario, highlighting the tension between developer culture and corporate professionalism, with the forced euphemism making it even more ridiculous."
