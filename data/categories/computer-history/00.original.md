- text: "The first computer bug was literally a moth. Now our bugs are much more sophisticated—they're features."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the famous 1947 incident where Grace Hopper found an actual moth in the Harvard Mark II computer, contrasting it with the modern developer's defense mechanism of calling bugs 'features.'"

- text: "Why did the ENIAC go to therapy? It had 18,000 vacuum tubes and trust issues."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure with ENIAC's actual specification (18,000 vacuum tubes) and applies human psychological problems to early computing hardware, creating incongruity."

- text: "Punch cards: where every mistake was literally a hole you couldn't fill."
  explanation: "A simple observational joke that highlights the unforgiving nature of punch card programming, using the double meaning of 'hole' as both physical reality and metaphorical problem."

- text: "What did the mainframe say to the programmer? 'I'll get back to you in 24 hours—I'm batch processing.'"
  explanation: "This personifies mainframe computers and their batch processing limitations, contrasting with modern instant feedback expectations."

- text: "Grace Hopper invented the compiler so programmers could argue in English instead of binary."
  explanation: "This joke acknowledges Grace Hopper's revolutionary contribution while suggesting that programming debates were inevitable regardless of the language level."

- text: "Why did Alan Turing name his machine 'Universal'? Because 'Eventually-Gets-There Machine' didn't fit on the paper."
  explanation: "A misdirection joke that plays on the Turing Machine's theoretical completeness versus its practical speed, using the setup of historical naming conventions."

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. Douglas Engelbart was just ahead of the organic computing trend."
  explanation: "This creates humor through anachronism, applying modern tech trends (organic, sustainable materials) to a 1960s invention that was wooden purely for practical reasons."

- text: "What's the difference between COBOL programmers in 1960 and COBOL programmers in 2024? The salary and the desperation level."
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke that highlights how COBOL went from cutting-edge to legacy maintenance, with programmers now being rare and expensive."

- text: "Why don't computer historians like Y2K jokes anymore? Because they're two decades past their expiration date."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that comments on the shelf-life of technology jokes while itself being a joke about Y2K, creating a self-referential layer."

- text: "The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace. She debugged code that wouldn't run for another century—talk about forward compatibility."
  explanation: "This celebrates Ada Lovelace's work on the Analytical Engine while creating humor through the absurdity of debugging code for a machine that was never built."

- text: "Why did the IBM PC succeed? Because 640K was enough for anybody to realize they needed more."
  explanation: "This references Bill Gates' (possibly apocryphal) quote while using incongruity to show how quickly that limitation became obvious."

- text: "What did the Commodore 64 say to the modern smartphone? 'I had more RAM than you have respect for your elders.'"
  explanation: "This personifies vintage computers and creates humor through the absurd comparison, since modern phones have millions of times more RAM."

- text: "The dot-com bubble: where everyone learned that '.com' doesn't automatically mean 'profitable.' Took billions to learn that lesson."
  explanation: "Observational humor about the late 1990s internet bubble, using relief theory to process the collective financial trauma through comedy."

- text: "Why was the Apple Lisa a failure? It was too ahead of its time and too behind on its price tag."
  explanation: "This joke uses the real history of the Apple Lisa's commercial failure, creating humor through the paradox of being simultaneously too advanced and too expensive."

- text: "What's a time traveler's favorite computer? The one that hasn't been invented yet, because backward compatibility is a nightmare."
  explanation: "This creates humor through absurdity by combining time travel with the very real programming problem of backward compatibility."

- text: "Dennis Ritchie created C, and then everyone created C++, C#, Objective-C, and C-ptsd from memory management."
  explanation: "A layered joke that lists real C-derived languages before delivering a punchline about manual memory management trauma, using wordplay with 'PTSD.'"

- text: "Why did the Xerox PARC researchers give away the GUI? They thought the real money was in photocopiers. Spoiler: it wasn't."
  explanation: "This references the famous story of Xerox PARC developing the graphical user interface but failing to commercialize it, using dramatic irony for humor."

- text: "The first computer network had two nodes and crashed during the first message. Today we have billions of nodes and... same problem, just more expensive."
  explanation: "This references the 1969 ARPANET crash when trying to send 'LOGIN' (only 'LO' got through) and creates humor by showing that fundamental problems persist despite technological advancement."

- text: "What did the punch card operator say to the new programmer? 'In my day, we couldn't just Ctrl+Z our mistakes—we had to throw away the whole card and start over, uphill, both ways.'"
  explanation: "This combines the real difficulty of punch card programming with the 'uphill both ways' meme, creating layered humor about generational technology differences."

- text: "Why is computer history written by the winners? Because the losers used Betamax, HD DVD, and Google Wave to store their documentation."
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke that plays on the phrase 'history is written by the winners' while listing actual failed technologies, suggesting that backing the wrong tech means your story disappears."

- text: "The ENIAC weighed 30 tons and could do 5,000 operations per second. Your phone weighs 200 grams and can do 5 trillion. But can your phone heat an entire room in winter? Checkmate, progress."
  explanation: "This uses the absurdity technique by initially setting up a comparison that favors modern technology, then finding the one 'advantage' of ENIAC (massive heat generation), creating humor through unexpected reframing of inefficiency as a feature."
