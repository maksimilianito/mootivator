- text: "Grace Hopper found the first computer bug. It was a moth. The second bug was a feature request."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the famous story of Admiral Grace Hopper finding an actual moth in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947, which popularized the term 'bug.' The punchline uses incongruity by suggesting the second 'bug' was actually a feature request, referencing the modern frustration of scope creep and endless feature additions in software development."

- text: "Why did ENIAC go to therapy? It had 18,000 vacuum tubes and trust issues."
  explanation: "This uses personification of the ENIAC, one of the first general-purpose computers, which actually had 17,468 vacuum tubes. The humor comes from applying human psychological problems to a machine, while the 'trust issues' references the unreliability of vacuum tube technology that frequently failed."

- text: "The first programmer was a woman. The first bug was blamed on a woman. Some things never change."
  explanation: "This is a sharp social commentary joke referencing Ada Lovelace as the first programmer and Grace Hopper's moth incident, while cleverly pointing out the persistent gender bias in tech. It uses the superiority theory to critique historical and ongoing discrimination."
  rating: 9

- text: "Alan Turing invented the computer. Then he had to invent the test to prove humans weren't computers. Ironic."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and historical reference to the Turing Test, which was designed to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. The reversal of expectations creates humor through incongruity."

- text: "Why did punch cards never become social media? They couldn't handle the comments section."
  explanation: "This anachronistic joke applies modern social media concepts to 1960s-era punch card technology. The humor comes from the absurdity of imagining punch cards dealing with internet comments, while referencing their limited data capacity."
  rating: 7

- text: "The Y2K bug taught us two things: always plan ahead, and never plan more than two digits ahead."
  explanation: "This self-contradictory joke uses the paradox method to highlight the famous Y2K problem where early programmers used two-digit year codes. It's funny because it points out the irony that planning ahead led to not planning far enough ahead."
  rating: 8

- text: "In 1969, we put a man on the moon with 4KB of RAM. Today, my smart toaster has more memory and it still burns my bread."
  explanation: "This comparative humor uses the relief theory to vent frustration about modern technology. It highlights the absurdity that despite massive technological advancement, we can't solve simple problems, while the Apollo Guidance Computer achieved the impossible with minimal resources."
  rating: 9

- text: "What did the mainframe say to the microcomputer? 'Back in my day, we filled entire rooms and we were grateful!'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'old person' trope applied to computers, creating humor through personification and the superiority theory. It references the evolution from room-sized mainframes to desktop PCs while parodying generational complaints."
  rating: 5

- text: "Steve Jobs put computers in our pockets. Now we can't put our phones in our pockets. Progress is weird."
  explanation: "This observational humor uses incongruity to point out the paradox that smartphones (pocket computers) have become too large for pockets, despite being marketed as portable devices. It's a commentary on feature creep versus usability."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't historians trust computer pioneers? Because they keep rewriting their legacy in the cloud."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay on 'rewriting' (both historical revision and code modification) and plays with the concept of cloud storage to suggest that computer history is constantly being modified, much like version control systems."
  rating: 6

- text: "Bill Gates said 640KB ought to be enough for anybody. He was right. We just needed 640KB to store that quote and laugh at it forever."
  explanation: "This is meta-humor that references the famous (possibly apocryphal) Gates quote about memory limitations. The irony is that we use vastly more memory just to preserve and mock the prediction, demonstrating how wrong it was."
  rating: 8

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. Now mice are wireless. Next, we'll make them imaginary and call it 'gesture control.'"
  explanation: "This progressive joke traces the evolution from Douglas Engelbart's wooden mouse prototype to modern wireless mice to gesture controls. The humor comes from the absurdity that we're essentially returning to pointing at things, but calling it innovation."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why was the Commodore 64 so popular? Because it was the only computer that could run on nostalgia and still boot faster than Windows 10."
  explanation: "This comparative joke uses anachronism and exaggeration to poke fun at modern operating system bloat. The C64 (1982) is contrasted with Windows 10, suggesting that older, simpler technology was superior in some ways."
  rating: 7

- text: "Dennis Ritchie created C. The world said 'Thank you.' Then they created C++. The world said 'Why?' Then came C#. The world just sighed."
  explanation: "This progressive joke traces programming language evolution with increasingly weary reactions. It uses the pattern of diminishing enthusiasm to comment on language proliferation and complexity, employing the relief theory for programmer frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a computer in 1985 and a computer in 2025? In 1985, you waited for it to load. In 2025, it waits for you to accept the terms and conditions."
  explanation: "This comparative joke uses incongruity to show how the bottleneck has shifted from technical limitations to legal/commercial ones. Despite massive speed improvements, we're still waiting—just for different reasons."
  rating: 9

- text: "Linus Torvalds created Linux in his bedroom. Now millions run their servers on it. His parents probably just wanted him to clean his room."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory and mundane juxtaposition, contrasting the world-changing creation of Linux with ordinary parental concerns. It humanizes tech legends while celebrating their achievements."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Xerox PARC researchers give away the GUI? They thought it was just a window into the future, not the whole building."
  explanation: "This clever wordplay references Xerox PARC's famous development of the graphical user interface, which they showed to Steve Jobs. The 'window' pun works on multiple levels, referencing both GUI windows and the idiom about opportunity."
  rating: 9

- text: "The internet was invented for military communication. Then came email. Then came spam. The military should have seen that coming—it's called 'unsolicited friendly fire.'"
  explanation: "This joke traces ARPANET's evolution from military network to spam-filled internet. The 'unsolicited friendly fire' phrase brilliantly combines military terminology with spam description, creating dark humor through unexpected comparison."
  rating: 9

- text: "Moore's Law says computing power doubles every two years. Murphy's Law says your computer will break the day after warranty expires. Both laws remain undefeated."
  explanation: "This joke combines two famous 'laws' in an absurdist comparison. It uses the relief theory to express frustration with planned obsolescence while acknowledging technological progress, creating humor through the juxtaposition of optimism and cynicism."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the Altair 8800 revolutionary? Because it came as a kit. You had to build your own computer. Now we can't even replace our own batteries. That's not progress, that's a subscription model."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke contrasts the DIY ethos of early computing (1975's Altair 8800) with modern planned obsolescence and subscription services. It's social commentary disguised as nostalgia, using incongruity to highlight how 'advancement' sometimes means less user control."
  rating: 9

- text: "In 1997, Deep Blue beat Kasparov at chess. In 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol at Go. In 2024, ChatGPT beat everyone at pretending it knows what it's talking about. Evolution is beautiful."
  explanation: "This progressive joke traces AI development through famous victories, but the punchline subverts expectations by suggesting the latest AI achievement is sophisticated BS rather than genuine intelligence. It's meta-humor that comments on LLMs' tendency toward confident incorrectness, using the absurdity technique to critique while celebrating AI progress."
