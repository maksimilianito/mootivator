- text: My debugger has a trust issue—it keeps asking "Are you sure?" like it's seen my code before.
  explanation: This joke plays on the common debugger feature of confirmation dialogs, personifying the debugger as skeptical of the programmer's abilities based on past experience with their buggy code.
  rating: 7

- text: Why did the profiler go to therapy? It had too many performance issues.
  explanation: This uses wordplay between "performance issues" as both a technical term for slow code execution and a psychological problem, applying the relief theory by making light of a common developer frustration.
  rating: 6

- text: I told my IDE I needed space. Now it won't stop adding whitespace to my code.
  explanation: This joke uses misdirection between needing personal space in a relationship and literal whitespace in code, personifying the IDE as a literal-minded partner.
  rating: 8

- text: The version control system and I have a complicated relationship—it keeps bringing up my past commits.
  explanation: This applies incongruity theory by treating version control like a grudge-holding partner who won't let go of past mistakes, mirroring how Git preserves all historical changes.

- text: My linter is the most judgmental coworker I've ever had, and it doesn't even buy me coffee.
  explanation: This personifies the linter as a critical colleague, using superiority theory by self-deprecating about receiving constant code criticism from an automated tool.
  rating: 7

- text: Why don't developers trust their debuggers? Because they always have breakpoints in the relationship.
  explanation: This uses double meaning with "breakpoints" as both a debugging feature and a metaphor for relationship problems, creating humor through technical wordplay.
  rating: 6

- text: I asked my code coverage tool for feedback. It said I'm only 60% of a developer.
  explanation: This joke applies incongruity by taking code coverage percentages (which measure test completeness) and absurdly applying them to measure a person's worth as a developer.
  rating: 8

- text: The memory profiler told me I have too much baggage. I said it was just cached emotional data.
  explanation: This creates humor by conflating memory profiling terms with psychological concepts, using "cached" and "baggage" to bridge technical and emotional domains.
  rating: 9

- text: My CI/CD pipeline is like my gym membership—it keeps running, but I'm not sure it's making anything better.
  explanation: This uses the relief theory to express common developer anxiety about whether automated processes actually improve code quality, comparing it to a relatable non-technical experience.
  rating: 8

- text: Why did the developer break up with their debugger? It kept stepping through their boundaries.
  explanation: This employs double meaning with "stepping through" as both a debugging action and a violation of personal boundaries, creating relationship humor from technical terminology.
  rating: 7

- text: I tried to have a heart-to-heart with my static analyzer. It just gave me 247 warnings about my approach.
  explanation: This uses incongruity by attempting emotional communication with a tool designed to find code problems, with the specific number adding authenticity to the absurd scenario.
  rating: 8

- text: The Docker container said it needed more space. I said, "You're literally designed for isolation."
  explanation: This joke plays on the double meaning of "space" and "isolation," applying container concepts to relationship dynamics in an absurdly literal way.
  rating: 9

- text: My test framework has commitment issues—it only does shallow renders.
  explanation: This uses React testing terminology ("shallow render") as a metaphor for fear of commitment, creating humor through the unexpected application of technical concepts to relationships.
  rating: 7

- text: Why do developers love their terminal emulators? Because they're the only thing that executes their commands without questions.
  explanation: This applies superiority theory by contrasting the obedient terminal with human relationships, finding humor in the fantasy of unquestioning compliance.
  rating: 6

- text: I told my package manager I needed dependency. Now I'm stuck in circular relationship hell.
  explanation: This creates humor through the double meaning of "dependency" and references the dreaded circular dependency problem, applying it to relationship dynamics.
  rating: 8

- text: My code formatter and I have an understanding—it pretends my code was always beautiful, and I pretend it did something.
  explanation: This uses incongruity to expose the sometimes superficial nature of code formatting, creating a humorous conspiracy between tool and user.
  rating: 7

- text: Why did the heap dump look so messy? Because it exposed everything the garbage collector was trying to hide.
  explanation: This personifies the garbage collector as trying to maintain appearances while the heap dump reveals all the "dirty laundry," using memory management as relationship metaphor.
  rating: 7

- text: The stack trace said it would always be there for me. Turns out it was just following me around documenting my failures.
  explanation: This brilliantly reframes stack traces from helpful debugging tool to judgmental observer, using misdirection between supportive presence and critical documentation.
  rating: 9

- text: I asked my build tool why it was so angry. It said, "You'd be angry too if you had to clean up after yourself 50 times a day."
  explanation: This personifies build tools with justified frustration, using the relief theory to express the absurdity of repeatedly rebuilding code due to small changes.
  rating: 8

- text: My debugger is like a therapist who charges by the breakpoint and only speaks in variable names.
  explanation: This creates layered humor by comparing debugging to therapy while adding absurd details about pricing and communication, using incongruity for maximum effect.
  rating: 8

- text: Why did the performance profiler win the argument? Because it had receipts for every millisecond you wasted, timestamped and graphed with 99th percentile confidence intervals.
  explanation: This joke achieves peak humor through excessive specificity and technical detail, personifying the profiler as the ultimate "receipts" keeper with forensic-level documentation of every inefficiency—the technical equivalent of someone who screenshots everything in an argument, but with statistical rigor that makes denial impossible.
