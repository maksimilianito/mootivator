- text: "I tried to read the GPL license, but my browser crashed. Turned out it was too open source."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'open source' - both the licensing model and the literal idea of something being so open it causes problems. The GPL (GNU General Public License) is famously lengthy, and the joke uses incongruity by suggesting the openness itself caused a technical failure."

- text: "Why did the developer avoid proprietary software? He didn't want to get locked in a relationship."
  explanation: "This uses the common term 'vendor lock-in' from software licensing discussions, applying it to personal relationships. The humor comes from treating software licensing decisions like dating choices, creating an unexpected parallel between technical and romantic commitment."

- text: "My code is like the MIT License - permissive to a fault."
  explanation: "The MIT License is known for being extremely permissive with few restrictions. This self-deprecating joke compares poorly written, unrestricted code to the license itself, suggesting the developer's code allows too much freedom, possibly leading to bugs or security issues."

- text: "What's the difference between a EULA and a novel? People pretend they've read both."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory by acknowledging the universal experience of clicking 'I agree' without reading End User License Agreements. The comparison to novels adds an extra layer by suggesting people also claim to have read books they haven't, creating a broader commentary on modern reading habits."

- text: "I released my code under the 'Do Whatever You Want But Don't Call Me' license."
  explanation: "This creates humor through absurdity by inventing a fictional license that captures the anxiety many developers feel about releasing code - wanting to share it but not wanting to deal with support requests or bug reports. It's a relatable sentiment packaged as a fake license name."

- text: "Why don't lawyers use GitHub? Too many commits to read through."
  explanation: "This plays on the parallel between legal contracts and code commits, suggesting that lawyers would treat code history like legal documents requiring thorough review. The incongruity comes from applying legal review standards to version control."

- text: "My manager asked if our software was open source. I said, 'The bugs are.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection - the setup suggests a licensing discussion, but the punchline reveals that only the problems are openly shared. It's a self-deprecating comment on software quality while playing with the concept of what gets 'released' to the public."

- text: "What do you call software that's free but makes you watch ads? Open sores."
  explanation: "This is a play on words between 'open source' and 'open sores,' suggesting that ad-supported free software is painful like a wound. It comments on the tension between free software ideals and monetization through advertising."

- text: "I tried to fork a proprietary repository. Got sued instead of pull requests."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts the open source practice of forking code with the legal consequences of trying to do the same with proprietary software. The parallel structure between 'fork/pull requests' (technical) and 'fork/lawsuits' (legal) creates the humor."

- text: "Why did the startup choose the Apache License? They wanted to scalp the competition."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'Apache' (both the software license and the Native American tribe) combined with business competition metaphors. It's a multi-layered pun that works on both the technical and historical levels, though it walks a fine line with cultural sensitivity."

- text: "A developer walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender says, 'That'll be free, but you need to accept our 47-page terms of service.' The developer dies of thirst."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke exaggerates the frustration of lengthy EULAs by applying them to a simple transaction. The extreme consequence (death) emphasizes how ridiculous it would be if all real-world transactions required the same level of legal agreement as software."

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to use GPL code? He believed in separation of church and state."
  explanation: "This joke references Richard Stallman's almost religious fervor about free software and the GPL's viral nature (requiring derivative works to also be GPL). By comparing it to religious doctrine and constitutional principles, it comments on the ideological aspects of licensing debates."

- text: "What's a pirate's favorite software license? The BSD - it has fewer arrrs."
  explanation: "This is a simple pun playing on pirate speech ('arrr') and the BSD license being less restrictive (fewer requirements/restrictions). It's lighthearted wordplay that doesn't require deep technical knowledge while still being license-specific."

- text: "My code is closed source. Not for security - I'm just too embarrassed to share it."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke subverts the common justification for proprietary software (security through obscurity) by admitting the real reason is shame about code quality. It's relatable to many developers who feel their code isn't good enough to show publicly."

- text: "Why did the developer create his own software license? The existing ones didn't have enough loopholes."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony by suggesting someone would intentionally create loopholes in their own license. It comments on how complex licenses can become and how people sometimes create custom licenses that defeat their own purpose."

- text: "I asked my lawyer to explain software licensing. Three billable hours later, I just made everything public domain."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the complexity and expense of understanding software licenses by showing an extreme reaction - giving up all rights just to avoid the headache. It's a story-format joke that builds to an absurd but understandable conclusion."

- text: "What did the GPL say to the MIT License at the party? 'You're too permissive. You need to have some boundaries.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes licenses as people with different personalities, with the GPL being the strict one lecturing the relaxed MIT License. It's a clever way to explain licensing philosophy differences through a social interaction metaphor."

- text: "A programmer released code under Creative Commons. His compiler refused to compile it, citing a category error."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke plays on the fact that Creative Commons licenses are typically for creative works, not software. The humor comes from imagining the compiler itself enforcing licensing categories, treating it as a type error - blending legal and programming concepts."

- text: "Why don't proprietary software companies like mirrors? They can't stand reflection."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning brilliantly - 'reflection' as both looking in a mirror and the programming concept of code introspection. Proprietary software often hides its internals, so it 'can't stand' either type of reflection. It's a sophisticated technical pun with social commentary."

- text: "I released my code under the Schrödinger License - it's simultaneously open and closed source until someone tries to fork it."
  explanation: "This quantum physics reference creates an absurd licensing concept that captures the uncertainty some developers feel about sharing code. The joke works on multiple levels: understanding Schrödinger's cat, knowing about forking, and appreciating the anxiety of open sourcing code."

- text: "What's the difference between the GPL and a vampire? One sucks your blood, the other ensures your derivatives remain free. Actually, developers can't agree on which is which."
  explanation: "This joke captures the heated debates around copyleft licenses by comparing them to vampires (viral nature) while acknowledging that opinions are deeply divided. The meta-humor of admitting the comparison works both ways depending on your perspective makes it especially clever and balanced."
