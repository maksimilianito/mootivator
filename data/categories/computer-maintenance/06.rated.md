- text: "My server's uptime is impressive—it's been running since the last time I remembered to check it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that good maintenance requires regular monitoring, but the speaker's lack of checking contradicts the claim of impressive uptime. It's a self-deprecating admission of poor maintenance habits."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the sysadmin bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud backups."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'cloud' computing—taking the metaphor literally. It's a simple misdirection where technical terminology meets physical reality."
  rating: 4

- text: "I practice preventive maintenance: I prevent myself from doing maintenance until something breaks."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'prevent' to create irony. The speaker claims to do preventive maintenance but actually describes reactive maintenance, the opposite of best practices."
  rating: 7

- text: "The best time to fix a bug is before the client notices. The second best time is never—just call it a feature."
  explanation: "This parodies the famous tree-planting proverb while highlighting the cynical 'feature not a bug' defense mechanism in software maintenance."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't servers ever go on vacation? Because they're afraid of coming back to a pile of unread logs."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes servers, comparing system logs to email accumulation during vacation—a relatable human experience applied to machines."
  rating: 5

- text: "My maintenance schedule is very consistent: consistently ignored."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the setup-punchline structure where 'consistent' initially suggests good practices, then subverts expectations with the reality of neglect."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my boss I need time for routine maintenance. He said, 'You mean like brushing your teeth?' I said, 'No, more like flossing—everyone knows they should do it, but nobody does.'"
  explanation: "This uses an extended metaphor comparing system maintenance to dental hygiene, specifically the universally neglected practice of flossing, creating relatability through shared human behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the database administrator sleep under the server rack? He wanted to be there for the 3 AM crash."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the dedication (or paranoia) of sysadmins who know systems tend to fail at the worst possible times, using absurdity to highlight a real frustration."
  rating: 6

- text: "Preventive maintenance is like going to the gym—I have a membership, a schedule, and excellent intentions."
  explanation: "This joke uses the familiar pattern of gym membership guilt to illustrate how maintenance plans often exist only on paper, never in practice."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the server go to therapy? It had too many unresolved issues and couldn't handle the load anymore."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes server problems using psychological terminology, where 'issues,' 'load,' and 'handle' all work as both technical and emotional terms."
  rating: 7

- text: "I run diagnostics regularly: every time something breaks, I diagnose that I should have run diagnostics regularly."
  explanation: "This creates a recursive loop of irony where the realization of needing diagnostics only comes after failure, highlighting the reactive nature of poor maintenance."
  rating: 8

- text: "A sysadmin walks into a bar. The bartender asks, 'Why the long face?' He replies, 'I just realized I haven't updated anything in six months.' The bartender says, 'What could go wrong?' They both start laughing, then crying."
  explanation: "This escalates from a classic joke setup through dramatic irony—both characters know the danger of outdated systems—ending in the emotional reality of impending disaster."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do sysadmins make terrible procrastinators? Because every time they put something off, it comes back as a critical emergency."
  explanation: "This plays on the consequences of delayed maintenance, where minor issues escalate into crises, teaching the painful lesson that procrastination in IT has exponential costs."
  rating: 7

- text: "My backup strategy is rock solid: I rock back and forth worrying about it, then solidify my fear by never testing it."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'rock solid' while describing the opposite of a good backup strategy, highlighting the common failure of never testing backups until disaster strikes."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the hard drive go to the doctor every month? Because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but a terabyte of backups is worth a career."
  explanation: "This updates the classic proverb with technical units, escalating from medical wisdom to IT survival instinct, showing the high stakes of data maintenance."
  rating: 7

- text: "A junior dev asks, 'Why do we keep three months of logs?' The senior dev replies, 'So when something breaks, we can pinpoint exactly when we should have fixed it.'"
  explanation: "This uses the mentor-student format to deliver dark humor about how logs serve more as archaeological evidence of negligence than actual preventive tools."
  rating: 9

- text: "I finally automated my maintenance tasks. Now instead of manually forgetting to do them, they automatically don't run because I forgot to set up the cron job properly."
  explanation: "This joke uses the irony of automation—meant to solve human error—being defeated by the same human error in its setup, creating a meta-level of failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the sysadmin become a gardener? He was tired of pruning logs, trimming processes, and watching things die from neglect in both careers anyway."
  explanation: "This creates an extended metaphor between system maintenance and gardening, using technical terms that work in both contexts, while acknowledging that neglect transcends professions."
  rating: 7

- text: "The five stages of system maintenance: 1) Denial ('It's running fine'), 2) Anger ('Why is it down?'), 3) Bargaining ('Just stay up until Monday'), 4) Depression ('We lost everything'), 5) Acceptance ('I should update my resume')."
  explanation: "This parodies the five stages of grief, applying them to the predictable lifecycle of neglected systems, with the final stage being career consequences rather than emotional peace."
  rating: 10

- text: "A server, a backup drive, and a monitoring system walk into a bar. Just kidding—the backup was never configured, the monitoring was silenced years ago, and the server can't walk because it's been running on one failing drive for eighteen months. But it's fine. Everything's fine."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic joke setup by refusing to deliver it, instead cataloging realistic maintenance failures with escalating absurdity, ending with the desperate mantra of denial that every sysadmin has whispered."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do maintenance windows feel like time travel? Because you schedule them for 2 AM on Sunday, arrive to find nothing's been updated since 2015, panic-patch everything while the sun comes up, and somehow end up in Monday morning with no memory of what you changed and a ticket queue from the future."
  explanation: "This creates a surreal narrative that captures the disorienting experience of emergency maintenance, where time becomes fluid, documentation disappears, and consequences arrive before you've finished causing them—a perfect storm of technical chaos and sleep deprivation."
