- text: "My firewall has trust issues."
  explanation: "This joke personifies a firewall by giving it a human psychological trait. The humor comes from the double meaning - firewalls are designed to not trust incoming connections by default, while 'trust issues' is a common phrase for people who have difficulty trusting others. It's a simple one-liner that plays on the technical function of a firewall."

- text: "Why did the password go to therapy? It had too many special characters."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'special characters' which in password requirements means symbols like @, #, $, but in human terms could mean problematic personality traits. The joke follows a classic setup-punchline structure and personifies the password as having psychological problems."

- text: "Encrypted my lunch in the office fridge. Now nobody can steal it, including me."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the incongruity of applying security measures so well that they backfire. The humor comes from the relatable situation of forgotten passwords or lost encryption keys, showing that perfect security can sometimes be too perfect."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't hackers ever get lost? They always find a backdoor."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'backdoor' - both a literal rear entrance to a building and a security vulnerability in software. The joke uses misdirection by setting up an expectation about navigation, then resolving with a security concept."

- text: "My password is 'incorrect' so when I forget it, the computer tells me 'your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This is a classic example of exploiting system messages for humor. The joke creates a logical loop where the error message becomes literally true, playing with the incongruity between the intended meaning and the actual password choice."

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break. It said 'Access Denied.'"
  explanation: "This personifies the computer as an unsympathetic boss or authority figure. The humor comes from applying a security response ('Access Denied') to a human need (taking a break), suggesting the computer has control over the user's life."

- text: "Why did the security expert bring a ladder to work? To implement higher-level encryption."
  explanation: "This joke uses a visual pun, playing on 'higher-level' both as a physical height requiring a ladder and as a technical term for more sophisticated encryption methods. The absurdity of the literal interpretation creates the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "Two-factor authentication: because one way to forget your password wasn't enough."
  explanation: "This is self-deprecating humor about the frustration of security measures. It highlights the relief theory - venting about the annoyance of increased security complexity while acknowledging it's necessary. The joke resonates with anyone who's struggled with 2FA."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the firewall feeling lonely? It kept blocking all its connections."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a firewall, giving it feelings of loneliness while describing its actual function. The humor comes from the contradiction between the firewall doing its job correctly and the emotional consequence of that job."

- text: "I changed all my passwords to 'BeefStew' but my computer said it wasn't stroganoff."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated pun combining password security with a food reference. 'Strong enough' becomes 'stroganoff' (beef stroganoff), creating humor through unexpected wordplay. The joke works on multiple levels for those familiar with both password requirements and the dish."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SQL injection attack walks into a bar. The bartender says 'Sorry, we sanitize all our inputs here.'"
  explanation: "This joke requires technical knowledge of SQL injection attacks and input sanitization. The humor comes from personifying a type of attack and having it interact with the real world, where security best practices are humorously applied to a social situation."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the cybersecurity expert refuse to play cards? Too many potential man-in-the-middle attacks."
  explanation: "This applies a technical security concept (man-in-the-middle attacks, where someone intercepts communication between two parties) to a mundane activity. The paranoia of the security expert becomes humorous when applied to a simple card game."
  rating: 7

- text: "My encryption is so strong, even I can't decrypt my old files. Mission accomplished?"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the paradox of security that works too well. The question mark at the end adds to the humor, showing the user's uncertainty about whether they've succeeded or failed, which is relatable to anyone who's lost access to their own encrypted data."
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know if someone uses a VPN? Don't worry, they'll tell you. And you won't know where they're telling you from."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke that combines the 'how do you know someone does X' format with actual VPN functionality. It works on two levels - mocking the tendency of VPN users to mention it, while also explaining what VPNs do (hide your location)."
  rating: 8

- text: "A hacker, a security expert, and a user walk into a bar. The hacker finds a vulnerability, the security expert patches it, and the user clicks on a phishing email in the bathroom."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic 'walks into a bar' setup but subverts it by having the punchline occur after they're inside. It humorously captures the eternal struggle of cybersecurity where the human element remains the weakest link despite technical safeguards."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the ransomware go to business school? To learn better negotiation tactics."
  explanation: "This personifies malware as having career ambitions and professional development goals. The dark humor comes from treating criminal activity as a legitimate business pursuit, which reflects the unfortunate reality that ransomware has become increasingly sophisticated and business-like."
  rating: 7

- text: "I practice security through obscurity. My code is so bad, no hacker wants to steal it."
  explanation: "This is self-deprecating humor that plays on 'security through obscurity' (a controversial security practice of hiding system details). The twist is that the 'obscurity' isn't intentional obfuscation but rather poor code quality, creating an accidental security measure."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't security professionals ever win at poker? They assume everyone is bluffing and refuse to trust any hand."
  explanation: "This joke applies the paranoid mindset necessary for good security work to a social situation. The humor comes from the superiority theory - we laugh at the security professional's inability to function normally because they're too good at their job."
  rating: 6

- text: "A zero-day vulnerability walks into a bar. The bartender says 'I haven't heard about you yet.' The vulnerability replies 'Exactly.'"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated technical humor about zero-day vulnerabilities (security flaws unknown to the software vendor). The joke personifies the vulnerability and creates humor through the logical consistency of the vulnerability's response - it's supposed to be unknown, making the bartender's ignorance the point."
  rating: 10

- text: "I asked my security team how to make an unbreakable password. They said to write it down and lose the paper. Now I have perfect security and no access."
  explanation: "This joke explores the paradox of perfect security through absurdist logic. It takes the advice to its logical extreme, showing how the ultimate in security (complete inaccessibility) defeats the purpose. The humor comes from the recognition that this is actually what happens when we create passwords that are too complex to remember."

- text: "Why did the penetration tester break up with the firewall? She kept finding holes in his story, and he kept blocking her attempts at communication. Their relationship had too many vulnerabilities, and neither could patch things up. In the end, they agreed it was a zero-day relationship - it was over before it even got properly documented."
  explanation: "This is an extended metaphor that weaves multiple security concepts into a relationship narrative. It works on several levels: 'holes' means both security vulnerabilities and lies, 'blocking' is both emotional and technical, 'patch' means both relationship repair and security fixes, and 'zero-day' creates a final twist. The joke demonstrates mastery of both relationship humor and technical terminology, creating rich, layered comedy that rewards technical knowledge while remaining accessible through the universal theme of failed relationships."
