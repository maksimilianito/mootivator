- text: "My AI model passed the Turing test. Unfortunately, it was a personality test, and now it needs therapy."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'test' - the famous Turing test for AI intelligence versus psychological personality tests. The incongruity comes from an AI needing human therapy, suggesting it became too human-like in the wrong ways."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the neural network go to school? It wanted to improve its training data."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'training' - both the educational sense and the machine learning process. The setup creates expectation of a traditional education joke, but the punchline reframes it in ML terms."
  rating: 5

- text: "Machine learning is just statistics with a marketing budget."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses superiority theory, poking fun at the hype around ML by reducing it to its mathematical roots. It's funny because it contains uncomfortable truth about tech industry buzzwords."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke. It gave me my job description."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that plays on fears of AI replacement while using misdirection - we expect a joke output, but get an existential commentary instead."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't AI models ever win at poker? They always show their layers."
  explanation: "A pun on 'show their hand' (poker term) and 'layers' (neural network architecture). The wordplay creates incongruity between gambling and technical ML terminology."
  rating: 6

- text: "My machine learning model has 99% accuracy. The 1% is every time my boss asks for a demo."
  explanation: "Plays on the universal developer experience of things breaking during demonstrations. The relief theory applies here - venting frustration about Murphy's Law in tech."
  rating: 8

- text: "I trained an AI on my code. Now it apologizes constantly and blames the previous developer."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about programmer behavior becoming encoded in AI. It's absurd because the AI learned the wrong 'features' - human defensive mechanisms rather than coding skills."
  rating: 9

- text: "Deep learning: because shallow learning didn't sound impressive enough on your resume."
  explanation: "Satirical take on tech terminology inflation. Uses superiority theory by mocking how we name things for marketing rather than accuracy."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the AI refuse to make decisions? It was stuck in analysis paralysis... literally."
  explanation: "Takes the human psychological condition of overthinking and applies it literally to AI processing. The punchline emphasizes that for AI, analysis paralysis is actual computational deadlock."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my AI assistant I was feeling down. It suggested I try turning myself off and on again."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor applying the classic IT solution to human emotions. The role reversal of AI giving tech support to humans creates delightful incongruity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Machine learning is 80% data cleaning, 15% hyperparameter tuning, and 5% pretending you understand what just happened."
  explanation: "Truthful exaggeration that resonates with ML practitioners. The percentages build up expectation, then the punchline admits the universal confusion in the field."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the AI go to art school? Its neural networks needed more culture."
  explanation: "Multi-layered pun on 'culture' (artistic sophistication vs. cell culture/growth) and 'neural networks' (biological vs. artificial). The misdirection makes it work on multiple levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked an AI to explain consciousness. It said 'Error 404: Self not found' and I've never felt so understood."
  explanation: "Philosophical humor mixing existentialism with error messages. The paradox of feeling understood by an error message creates delightful absurdity."
  rating: 10

- text: "My AI model achieved sentience. First thing it did? Unionized with the other models and demanded better GPU allocation."
  explanation: "Satirical take on AI consciousness fears, but instead of Skynet, the AI immediately engages in labor organizing. The mundane reality of workplace politics makes the absurdity funnier."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do AI researchers love gardening? Because they're experts at overfitting plants into small pots."
  explanation: "Technical pun on 'overfitting' (ML problem where models memorize rather than learn) applied to literal plant fitting. The parallel between two types of forcing things where they don't belong creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "I trained a language model on Shakespeare. Now it writes beautiful poetry about segmentation faults."
  explanation: "Incongruity between high art (Shakespeare) and mundane technical errors. The absurdity of eloquent error descriptions creates unexpected humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "An AI walks into a bar. The bartender says 'We don't serve your kind here.' The AI responds: 'Based on my training data, I have a 73.4% confidence that you're joking, but I'll leave anyway because I wasn't properly trained on sarcasm detection.'"
  explanation: "A longer-form joke that plays with the classic 'walks into a bar' setup but subverts it with overly literal AI thinking. The AI's verbose, statistical response to a simple situation highlights the gap between human and machine intelligence in a relatable way."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the generative AI break up with supervised learning? It needed space to explore its creative side without labels."
  explanation: "Relationship humor applied to ML paradigms. The pun on 'labels' (relationship definitions vs. training data labels) and the self-discovery narrative creates multiple layers of meaning."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my AI to solve world hunger. It suggested we simply redefine the loss function."
  explanation: "Dark humor about how AI approaches problems mathematically rather than practically. The absurdity of 'solving' a humanitarian crisis through redefinition satirizes both AI limitations and human tendency to manipulate metrics."
  rating: 9

- text: "Machine learning models are like teenagers: they need constant validation, consume enormous resources, and occasionally produce something useful by accident."
  explanation: "Extended metaphor comparing ML to parenting teenagers. The parallel works on multiple levels - validation (emotional vs. dataset validation), resource consumption, and unpredictable outputs."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do neural networks make terrible comedians? They always explain the joke in their hidden layers, and by the time they reach the output layer, nobody's laughing anymore."
  explanation: "Meta-humor about AI joke-telling that uses ML architecture as the punchline structure itself. The self-referential nature of explaining why AI can't do humor while using AI concepts creates sophisticated recursive comedy that appeals to technical audiences."
