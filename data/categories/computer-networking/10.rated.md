- text: "My network topology looks like a star, but performs like a bus."
  explanation: "This joke plays on network topology types (star and bus) while using 'bus' in its colloquial meaning of something that's slow and unreliable, creating a humorous contrast between design and reality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the packet go to therapy? It had too many hops and couldn't find its way home."
  explanation: "This uses the networking concept of 'hops' (routers a packet passes through) and applies it to a psychological context, personifying the packet as someone lost and needing help."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my router a joke. It didn't laugh—just kept forwarding it to everyone else."
  explanation: "This plays on the router's function of forwarding packets, comparing it to someone who doesn't get a joke but shares it anyway, a relatable human behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "The network engineer broke up with his girlfriend. She said he was too distant, but he insisted it was just latency."
  explanation: "This creates a double meaning between emotional distance in relationships and network latency, showing how technical terminology can humorously reframe personal situations."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't networks ever tell secrets? Because they're always broadcasting."
  explanation: "This exploits the networking term 'broadcasting' (sending data to all devices) and contrasts it with the idea of keeping secrets, creating an incongruity between network behavior and discretion."
  rating: 6

- text: "My Wi-Fi password is 'incorrect.' That way, when someone asks for it, I can say 'The password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This is a classic misdirection joke that plays on the dual meaning of 'incorrect' as both a password and an error message, creating confusion through linguistic ambiguity."
  rating: 9

- text: "A TCP packet walks into a bar and says, 'I'd like a beer.' The bartender says, 'You'd like a beer?' The packet replies, 'Yes, I'd like a beer.'"
  explanation: "This references TCP's three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) by having the conversation mirror the connection establishment process, demonstrating protocol behavior through dialogue."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the switch go to school? To learn how to handle its tables better."
  explanation: "This uses the networking concept of MAC address tables that switches maintain, applying it to an educational context where 'handling tables' becomes a skill to be learned."
  rating: 5

- text: "I tried to explain subnetting to my cat. Now it only responds to specific IP ranges."
  explanation: "This absurd scenario applies the technical concept of subnetting (dividing networks into smaller segments) to animal behavior, creating humor through impossible technical conditioning."
  rating: 7

- text: "The difference between UDP and my ex? UDP actually acknowledges when it doesn't care."
  explanation: "This contrasts UDP's connectionless nature (no acknowledgments) with relationship dynamics, using the technical characteristic to make a self-deprecating relationship joke."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the network administrator go broke? Too many dropped packets and not enough bandwidth."
  explanation: "This applies networking problems (packet loss and insufficient bandwidth) to personal finance, creating a metaphor between network performance and financial management."
  rating: 5

- text: "My network cable is like my motivation—it works until you look at it too closely, then it fails for no reason."
  explanation: "This compares the frustrating intermittent failures of physical network connections to psychological states, using the relatable experience of cables that mysteriously stop working."
  rating: 8

- text: "How many network engineers does it take to change a light bulb? None—they just route around the darkness."
  explanation: "This plays on the networking concept of routing around failures, applying problem-solving methodology to a non-technical situation in a classic light bulb joke format."
  rating: 8

- text: "I named my network 'FBI Surveillance Van #4.' My neighbors finally stopped asking for the password."
  explanation: "This joke uses social engineering and humor about privacy concerns to solve the practical problem of neighbors requesting Wi-Fi access, showing clever application of psychology."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why was the Ethernet cable depressed? It felt like everyone was going wireless and leaving it behind."
  explanation: "This personifies Ethernet cables during the transition to wireless networking, creating empathy for obsolete technology through the lens of abandonment and technological evolution."
  rating: 7

- text: "A network engineer's spouse says, 'You care more about your packets than me!' The engineer replies, 'That's not true—you have much higher priority in my QoS settings.'"
  explanation: "This uses Quality of Service (QoS) networking concepts to address relationship priorities, showing how technical thinking can be humorously applied to personal life, though perhaps not wisely."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the ping command feel lonely? Because every time it reached out, all it got back was an echo."
  explanation: "This creates a melancholic personification of the ping command, where its technical function (sending echo requests) becomes a metaphor for one-sided communication and loneliness."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my network it was having an identity crisis. It replied, 'No, I'm just experiencing ARP poisoning.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke references ARP poisoning (a network attack that causes identity confusion) and frames it as a psychological condition, creating humor through the parallel between security vulnerabilities and mental health."
  rating: 8

- text: "The OSI model walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we only serve layers 1 through 7.' The model replies, 'Perfect, I'll take one of each, but please serve them in order.'"
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates deep understanding of the OSI model's seven layers and their sequential nature, using the bar setting to illustrate the importance of proper layering in network protocols."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do network packets make terrible comedians? Because half of them never arrive, and the ones that do are out of order."
  explanation: "This meta-joke about joke-telling uses packet loss and out-of-sequence delivery to explain why networks would fail at comedy, creating humor by applying network problems to performance art."
  rating: 9

- text: "A network engineer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'Welcome! The latency here is zero, bandwidth is infinite, and we've never had a single packet loss.' The engineer thinks for a moment and asks, 'So... this is hell, isn't it? Because that's completely unrealistic and I'd have nothing to troubleshoot.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke plays on the engineer's identity being so tied to problem-solving that perfection becomes its own form of torture, using the concept of an ideal network as a paradoxical nightmare for someone whose purpose is fixing problems."
