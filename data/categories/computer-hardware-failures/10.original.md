- text: "My hard drive crashed. Now it's just a hard sit."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on the word 'drive' - when the hard drive fails, it's no longer 'driving' or working, so it becomes a 'hard sit'. This uses wordplay and the physical metaphor of movement versus stillness to represent functional versus broken hardware."

- text: "Why did the RAM go to therapy? It had too many issues to address."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'address' - in computing, RAM addresses are memory locations, but in everyday language, 'address' means to deal with problems. The setup creates expectation of a personal problem, then delivers a technical punchline."

- text: "My motherboard died. The funeral was very emotional - everyone was in tears, especially the capacitors."
  explanation: "This plays on capacitors being electronic components that can physically leak or 'cry' when they fail, while also personifying the hardware failure as a death that causes emotional tears. It's a layered joke combining technical knowledge with human emotion."

- text: "The GPU overheated and quit. It said the working conditions were too hot to handle."
  explanation: "This personifies the GPU giving its resignation due to poor working conditions (overheating), which mirrors actual workplace complaints. The humor comes from applying human labor rights concepts to hardware failure."

- text: "Why don't failed hard drives ever get invited to parties? Because they're always bringing up bad sectors."
  explanation: "A play on 'bad sectors' (damaged areas on a hard drive) and the social concept of someone who brings up bad topics or 'sectors' of conversation at parties. Uses double meaning and social awkwardness metaphor."

- text: "My computer's power supply failed. It just couldn't handle the current situation."
  explanation: "A pun on 'current' meaning both electrical current (which power supplies manage) and the present moment/situation. The incongruity comes from applying emotional overwhelm language to electrical failure."

- text: "I asked my broken CPU how it was feeling. It said it had lost its core values."
  explanation: "CPUs have multiple cores, and 'core values' in human terms means fundamental beliefs. The joke personifies the CPU as having an existential crisis when its cores fail, mixing technical and philosophical language."

- text: "The network card crashed into the sound card. Now there's static on both channels."
  explanation: "This creates a physical collision metaphor for hardware failure, where 'static' can mean both network interference and audio noise. It's absurd because cards can't literally crash into each other inside a computer."

- text: "My SSD failed after I told it to relax. Turns out it took 'solid state' too literally and just froze."
  explanation: "Plays on 'solid state' (the technology behind SSDs) and the physical states of matter. The joke suggests the drive misunderstood advice to relax and became frozen (solid), which is also what happens when computers crash."

- text: "Why did the failing hard drive become a philosopher? It spent all its time seeking the meaning of life, or at least the meaning of its spinning."
  explanation: "Combines the physical spinning of hard drives with existential philosophy. A failing drive often makes unusual noises and spins erratically, which is humorously reframed as a philosophical quest for meaning."

- text: "The cooling fan broke and left a note: 'I'm exhausted from always being taken for granted. You only notice me when I'm gone.'"
  explanation: "This personifies the cooling fan with genuine emotional grievances. Fans are indeed only noticed when they fail and the system overheats, making this a commentary on unappreciated infrastructure with genuine emotional resonance."

- text: "My RAM stick died peacefully in its sleep. The doctor said it was a case of memory loss."
  explanation: "A dark humor approach using medical euphemisms for death ('died peacefully in sleep') combined with the technical reality that RAM stores memory. The double meaning of 'memory loss' works both medically and technically."

- text: "Why don't capacitors make good friends? Because when they fail, they tend to bulge under pressure and eventually explode the relationship."
  explanation: "Capacitors physically bulge and can explode when failing. This is mapped onto relationship dynamics where people 'explode' under pressure. The technical accuracy of capacitor failure makes the metaphor particularly effective."

- text: "I tried to revive my dead motherboard with a defibrillator. The technician said I was confusing hardware with wetware."
  explanation: "Plays on the absurdity of treating computer hardware like a human patient, while introducing the term 'wetware' (biological systems). The incongruity between medical and technical repair approaches creates the humor."

- text: "The graphics card overheated and started hallucinating. It began rendering things that weren't even in the program - mostly beaches and ice cream."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes GPU failure as having fever dreams or hallucinations. Overheating GPUs do produce visual artifacts, which are humorously reframed as the GPU dreaming of cool places. The absurdist imagery of beaches and ice cream adds to the humor."

- text: "My BIOS chip failed and now my computer has amnesia. It wakes up every morning asking 'Who am I?' and 'What's my boot sequence?'"
  explanation: "The BIOS stores basic system information, so its failure is compared to amnesia. The existential questions mirror both technical boot sequence issues and human identity crises, creating layered humor."

- text: "Why did the hard drive go to the chiropractor? Because it had bad sectors and needed realignment. The chiropractor said 'I can't help you - you need a disk doctor, not a back doctor.'"
  explanation: "This creates a elaborate misdirection by setting up a medical visit, then revealing confusion between 'disk' alignment (technical) and spinal alignment (medical). The punchline's self-aware correction adds meta-humor."

- text: "The CPU started throttling itself. When I asked why, it said 'I'm practicing self-care. You kept pushing me to 100% all the time, and I read online that burnout is real.'"
  explanation: "This maps modern workplace self-care culture onto CPU thermal throttling. The humor comes from the CPU being self-aware enough to read about burnout and implement boundaries, which is both absurd and relatable."

- text: "My computer's hardware failed so catastrophically that the error message just said 'I don't even know where to begin.' Even the diagnostic software needed therapy."
  explanation: "This escalates the personification to include the error reporting system itself being overwhelmed. The meta-humor of diagnostic software needing therapy creates an absurd recursive loop of failure."

- text: "The motherboard, CPU, RAM, and GPU all failed simultaneously. The post-mortem report concluded it was a suicide pact. They left a note: 'If we can't run Crysis on maximum settings, we don't want to run at all.'"
  explanation: "This dark comedy references the infamous 'Can it run Crysis?' meme while creating an elaborate narrative of hardware components making a collective decision. The dramatic escalation from simple failure to coordinated protest with existential demands creates multi-layered absurdist humor."

- text: "I found my old hard drive in the attic. It had developed mechanical Alzheimer's - it remembered the first files I ever saved in perfect detail, but couldn't recall anything from the last five years. We sat together as it told stories about Windows 95 and asked repeatedly 'Have you defragmented me lately?'"
  explanation: "This creates a poignant parallel between mechanical drive degradation and human cognitive decline. The specific detail of remembering old data but not new mirrors actual Alzheimer's symptoms, while the repeated question adds both technical accuracy (old drives needed defragmentation) and emotional depth. The image of sitting with an aging drive creates unexpected tenderness in hardware failure humor."
