## We practice continuous integration. We continuously integrate bugs into production.
## My manager asked me to estimate the project timeline. I said three months. He said 'be realistic.' So I said six months. He approved two weeks.
## Our standup meetings are very efficient. We finish in 15 minutes. Then we have a 45-minute discussion about what was said in the standup.
## Our definition of done has 47 checkboxes. We consider a story done when we've checked the first one and moved on to the next story.
## We've achieved DevOps maturity. Now developers can break production without waiting for operations to do it first.
## Our team practices extreme programming. Extremely long hours, extremely tight deadlines, and extremely optimistic estimates.
## Our CI/CD pipeline is so advanced, we can deploy bugs to production three times faster than our competitors.
## Our documentation is always up to date—it's just from a different timeline.
## I love Agile methodology. It lets me fail faster and more frequently than ever before.
## Why do developers prefer dark mode? Because their code review comments are already dark enough.
## Our CI/CD pipeline is so automated, even the bugs deploy themselves.
## Why don't developers trust Agile estimates? Because 'two weeks' is a unit of time that exists only in theory.
## I love pair programming. It's like having someone watch you fail in real-time.
## What's the most optimistic phrase in software development? 'This should be a quick fix.'
## Our technical debt is so high, we're considering filing for architectural bankruptcy.
## I asked how long the migration would take. They said 'three sprints.' That was eight sprints ago.
## What's the difference between a roadmap and fiction? Fiction has better plot consistency.
## Our MVP has been in beta for so long, the M now stands for 'Maybe' and the V for 'Vaporware.'
## Why do developers love agile? Because 'we'll fix it in the next sprint' sounds better than 'I don't know how to solve this.'
## The project manager asked for an estimate. I said two weeks. He heard two days. We both knew it would be two months.
## I love it when stakeholders say 'just a small change' during code freeze. It's like 'just a small iceberg' to the Titanic.
## Our retrospective action items from six months ago? They're now called 'technical debt.'
## Our velocity chart looks like my EKG during deployment: lots of spikes and concerning flatlines.
## Why don't developers trust pair programming? Because merge conflicts are easier to resolve than personality conflicts.
## Our MVP has been in beta for three years. At this point, the 'M' stands for 'Maybe' and the 'V' for 'Very Not.'
## Our code review process is very thorough: first we approve it, then we deploy it, then we review what went wrong.
## Our definition of 'done' has more exceptions than our error handling.
## We practice continuous integration. We continuously integrate new bugs into production.
## The code review process has four stages: denial, anger, bargaining, and 'approved with comments.'
## The only thing we deploy faster than code is blame when it breaks.
## Our technical debt is so high, we're paying interest in the form of weekend deployments.
## The retrospective revealed our biggest impediment was the retrospective.
## We achieved DevOps nirvana: developers and operations are now equally miserable.
## The architect said we'd have 'separation of concerns.' Now the frontend and backend teams won't speak to each other.
## We practice test-driven development. First we test management's patience, then we develop excuses for missing the deadline.
## Why did the developer refuse to write documentation? He said the code was self-explanatory... from 2019.
## Our definition of 'done' includes: works on my machine, passes one test, and looks good in the demo.
## We practice continuous integration: our code continuously integrates bugs into production.
## My favorite agile principle? 'Responding to change over following a plan'—especially when the change is reverting to the original plan.
## Our technical debt is so high, we're paying interest in the form of weekend deployments.
## A product manager, a designer, and a developer walk into a bar. The developer says, 'We need to refactor the bar first.'
## Why did the team switch from Scrum to Kanban? They got tired of pretending two-week sprints were different from two-week deadlines.
## Our MVP strategy: ship it broken, call it beta, and let users find the bugs for free.
## Our retrospectives are very productive: we identify the same three problems every sprint and agree to do nothing about them.
## We finally achieved 100% test coverage! The test just checks if the application starts. Once.
## Why did the developer refuse to use waterfall? Because they preferred their projects to fail in two-week increments instead of all at once.
## Minimum Viable Product: The art of convincing stakeholders that 'barely functional' is a feature.
## Our standup meetings are so long, we're considering renaming them to 'sit-downs.'
## Technical debt is just a fancy term for 'we'll definitely fix this later,' which is a fancy term for 'never.'
## Why don't developers trust the staging environment? Because it's always acting like production until you actually need it to.
## Our retrospectives are so productive, we've identified the same three issues for six months straight.
## Test-driven development: Write the test first, watch it fail, then write code until both the test and your spirit pass.
## Our CI/CD pipeline is so advanced, we can deploy broken code to production in under thirty seconds.
## Microservices architecture: Because if you're going to have deployment problems, you might as well have them in fifty places simultaneously.
## Why did the developer's estimate change from 2 days to 2 weeks? He started reading the requirements.
## Our definition of 'done' has seventeen criteria. Shipping to production isn't one of them.
## We practice continuous integration. The build has been continuously broken for three days.
## Our standup meeting is now in its 45th minute. Three people are still standing, but only out of spite.
## The retrospective action items from last sprint: 'Improve communication.' Status: We didn't communicate about it.
## Our velocity is increasing! We've started counting bugs as features.
## We're adopting agile! First step: a six-month planning phase to determine how to be flexible.
## The ticket says 'simple UI change.' The dependency graph looks like a subway map for a city that doesn't exist.
## Our code coverage is 95%! The other 5% is where all the actual business logic lives.
## We follow TDD religiously: Trauma-Driven Development. Every feature is built in response to a production incident.
## Our deployment process has five environments: Dev, Test, Staging, Pre-prod, and 'Oh God What Happened in Production.'
## We've achieved true DevOps: the developers operate the pagers, and operations develops a deep resentment.
## Our definition of 'done' has more exceptions than rules.
## We practice continuous integration. We're continuously integrating yesterday's bugs into today's code.
## What's the difference between a junior developer and a senior developer? The junior developer thinks the code review is about the code.
## Our standup meetings are so long, we had to rename them 'sit-downs.'
## We're so agile, our requirements change faster than our coffee gets cold.
## Our technical debt is so high, we're paying interest in developer tears.
## What do you call a developer who actually reads the requirements? Unemployed—they're too slow.
## Our MVP has so many features, we renamed it to MLP: Maximum Lovable Product.
## We're not behind schedule. We're just giving our future selves more opportunities for career growth through legacy code maintenance.
## Our code review process is very thorough: First we review the code, then we review why we wrote it that way, then we review our life choices.
## What's the difference between a software roadmap and a work of fiction? The fiction has better plot consistency and fewer surprise endings.
## We follow the SCRUM methodology: Suddenly Changing Requirements Undermine Months of work.
## Why did the developer get promoted to architect? Because he was finally far enough from the code that his estimates sounded believable.
## Our deployment process has three stages: Testing, Production, and Apology.
## Why do we call it 'technical debt'? Because like real debt, we keep making minimum payments and hoping it goes away.
## Our code review process is very democratic - everyone gets to say 'looks good to me' without reading it.

## Our definition of done keeps evolving. Currently, it's defined as 'when the PM stops asking questions.'
## What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's code review comments? About 500 words of diplomatic phrasing.
## We practice continuous integration. Our build breaks continuously, and we integrate apologies into our daily standups.
## Our retrospectives are very productive. We've identified the same three problems for six months now.
## Our code review process is thorough. First, we review the code. Then, we review our life choices.

## User feedback: 'I love how minimalist this is!' Translation: 'Where did you hide everything I need?'
## What do you call a user interface that works perfectly? A prototype that hasn't met real users yet.
## Why did the modal dialog go to therapy? It had serious boundary issues.

## User feedback: 'Make it pop!' UX Designer's translation: 'I have no idea what I want.'
## How many users does it take to test a feature? Five. The sixth will do something no one imagined possible.
## User: 'Where's the save button?' Designer: 'It auto-saves.' User: 'But where do I click to feel productive?'
## The three states of a button: hover, active, and 'why did the user click that?'

## Our users love the new design! (Translation: Only three people complained today instead of thirty.)
## Why don't users read instructions? Because the interface should be the instruction manual.
## User testing revealed our interface is perfect. We tested it on ourselves.
## I asked users what they wanted. They said 'faster horses.' So I built them a carousel that spins really fast.
## The button says 'Submit.' Users think it means 'surrender.' They're not wrong.
## Our app has a 90% satisfaction rating! (We only surveyed the users who didn't uninstall it.)
## User: 'Where's the save button?' Designer: 'It autosaves.' User: 'But where's the button?' Designer: *cries in progressive enhancement*
## I designed a user interface so simple, even my grandmother could use it. Turns out my grandmother is a UX designer.

## Tech support: Where 'It's working fine on my end' is both our greatest weapon and our customers' greatest frustration.
## Tech support drinking game: Take a shot every time someone says 'It was working yesterday.' You'll be unconscious by lunch.
## Remote tech support: Where we can fix everything except the user's inability to accurately describe colors, directions, or what they clicked.
## Tech support is 10% technical knowledge and 90% convincing people you're not judging them.
## Tech support: where your 'emergency' is someone else's 'forgot their password.'
## Customer: 'The internet is down!' Tech support: 'What color are the lights on your router?' Customer: 'How should I know? The internet is down!'
## A help desk ticket: 'Urgent! My keyboard isn't working!' Tech support's first reply: 'Please type your employee ID to verify.'
## Tech support discovered the root cause of 90% of issues: the user. The other 10%: also the user, but we're too polite to say it.
## Tech support's most advanced diagnostic tool: asking the user to describe the problem again while you frantically Google it.

## Virtual machines are like imaginary friends, except they actually consume your resources.
## I told my VM it was special. Then I cloned it 47 times.
## Containers are just VMs that went on a diet and got commitment issues.
## My Docker containers have better isolation than I did during lockdown.
## Kubernetes tried to orchestrate my life. Now I have 47 replicas and still can't find the original me.
## My VM snapshots are like my New Year's resolutions. I keep creating them but never go back to them.
## Virtual machines: because running one operating system at a time is for people without trust issues.
## My Docker Compose file is longer than my last relationship. At least the containers are more reliable.
## Nested virtualization is like Russian nesting dolls, except each doll complains about performance overhead and blames the doll containing it.
## My hypervisor is overcommitted. I told it to learn to say no, but it just allocated more memory it doesn't have.
## I tried to explain Docker to my parents. Now they think I work at a shipping company.
## Virtual machines are like teenagers—they consume all your resources and still complain they don't have enough memory.
## I spun up 50 containers to test scalability. Now I understand why they call it 'orchestration'—it's complete chaos without a conductor.
## My VM snapshots are like my New Year's resolutions—I create them with good intentions, never look at them again, and they just take up space.
## Containers promised to solve dependency hell. Now I have dependency purgatory—it's the same suffering, just more organized.
## I finally achieved perfect container immutability. Unfortunately, that includes my career prospects—they haven't changed in years either.
## Why did the container refuse to talk to the VM? It had too much overhead.
## Docker containers are like teenagers - they think they're independent but they still need the host to survive.
## I have 99 problems and they're all running in different VMs.
## Containers promised to solve dependency hell. Now I have orchestration hell instead.
## Why do VMs make terrible comedians? Their timing is always off due to clock drift.
## Snapshots: because 'Ctrl+Z' for your entire operating system wasn't ambitious enough.
## Why did the container go to therapy? It had abandonment issues after being killed and respawned 47 times that day.
## My hypervisor is like a landlord - it promises isolation but everyone can still hear their neighbors.
## I run everything in containers now. My therapist says I have compartmentalization issues.
## Why did the sysadmin break up with virtualization? Too many commitment issues - everything was ephemeral.
## My container orchestration is so complex, even Kubernetes looked at it and said 'that's a bit much.'
## I asked my VM if it was real or just a simulation. It said 'yes' and then kernel panicked.
## I tried to explain virtualization to my grandma. She said she's been doing it for years - it's called daydreaming.
## How many hypervisors does it take to change a lightbulb? None - they just spin up a new instance with working lights.
## My Docker containers are like my New Year's resolutions - I create dozens of them in January and most are stopped by February.
## I have 50 VMs running on my server. My therapist says I'm avoiding commitment by never settling on just one OS.
## Why did the sysadmin break up with virtualization? Too many nested relationships.
## I started a support group for VMs that don't know they're virtualized. We call it 'The Hypervisor Truman Show.'
## Why do containers make terrible roommates? They refuse to share kernel space and insist on their own namespace.
## My server runs so many VMs, it's basically a digital landlord collecting CPU rent. I'm worried it's going to start gentrifying the memory space.
## Why did the container go to therapy? It had too many layers to unpack.
## Virtualization is just computers doing impressions of other computers.
## My hypervisor is like a helicopter parent—it manages everything and nothing can run without its permission.
## Docker: Because 'it works on my machine' needed an upgrade to 'it works in my container.'
## My VM is so old, it remembers when 'cloud' just meant rain was coming.
## Containers are just VMs that went on a diet and got really good at meal prep.
## I tried to explain nested virtualization to my grandmother. Now she thinks my computer has Russian dolls inside.
## Kubernetes: Where 'it works on my machine' becomes 'it works on my 47 machines, but differently on each one.'
## I asked my VM how it was feeling. It said 'isolated' but I think that's just its network mode talking.
## Virtualization is the only place where having multiple personalities isn't a disorder—it's a feature. And we charge extra for it.
## Why did the Docker container break up with the VM? It said 'You're carrying too much baggage. I need someone who shares my kernel values.'
## My code is so optimized, it finishes before it starts. Now I have a causality bug.
## The database was slow, so we added an index. Now it's a slow database with an index.
## I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My users still complain it's slow. Turns out n is a billion.
## Our server handles millions of requests per second! Just not the ones from actual users.
## I spent three weeks optimizing my code to run in 2 seconds instead of 3. The function is called once a day.

## Our system handles millions of requests per second! The problem is we're only getting dozens.
## I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes three weeks to run.
## Why did the developer optimize the wrong function? Because the profiler output was too slow to read.
## My code runs at O(1) complexity. The '1' stands for '1 hour per operation.'
## I finally found the memory leak! Turns out I was storing every mistake I've ever made. No wonder it was so large.
## I optimized my code so much it started running before I wrote it.
## My computer has two speeds: too slow and suspiciously fast.

## My startup's tech stack is so cutting-edge, our biggest performance bottleneck is waiting for the documentation to be written.
## Why did the algorithm go to therapy? It had O(n²) issues but was in denial about its complexity.
## Performance tuning is just moving the bottleneck around until it lands on someone else's service.
## I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes 3 hours.
## Why don't programmers like to optimize code? Because premature optimization is the root of all evil, but so is slow code.
## My algorithm is O(1). Unfortunately, the constant is 3 hours.
## Why did the SQL query go to therapy? It had too many JOIN issues and couldn't relate to anyone anymore.
## I added multithreading to speed things up. Now my code has race conditions AND it's still slow.
## I spent three weeks optimizing code that runs once a month. I'm very efficient at being inefficient.
## The software runs perfectly on my machine. Unfortunately, we need it to run on the customer's potato.
## I parallelized my code across 16 cores. It now takes 16 times longer due to synchronization overhead. At least it uses all the cores.
## I finally found the performance bottleneck. It was all the code I wrote to find the performance bottleneck.
## Our database is so slow, we've started taking bets on which query will finish first. I'm down $50 on a simple SELECT statement.
## My code is so optimized it achieves O(0) complexity. It doesn't run at all.
## I optimized my code so much it now runs before I execute it.
## My program has two speeds: not working and not working fast enough.
## I added caching to fix the performance issue. Now I have two problems and one of them is really fast.
## My code is so optimized, the bottleneck is now the speed of light.
## I don't have performance issues. My users just have unrealistic expectations about the space-time continuum.
## Premature optimization is the root of all evil. So I wait until production to panic.
## My algorithm runs in O(1) time. The '1' is just measured in geological epochs.
## I parallelized my code across 100 cores. Now it crashes 100 times faster.
## Why do quantum computers never have performance issues? Because they're simultaneously fast and slow until you measure them.
## My code is so efficient it optimized itself out of existence. Now I'm debugging nothing and it's still too slow.
## I implemented a performance improvement that makes everything 50% faster. The catch? It only works if you don't look at the code.

## Why did the programmer optimize the wrong function? Because profiling is for people who have time to find out what's actually slow.
## Our load balancer doesn't balance loads. It judges them, finds them wanting, and drops them entirely.
## I achieved zero-latency communication between services. They're now all running on the same thread and blocking each other.
## Our database queries are so optimized, they return results before you finish typing the question. Unfortunately, they're usually wrong.
## My algorithm has O(1) complexity. One hour, that is.
## I optimized my code so much, it finished before I started it. Now I have causality errors in my logs.
## The first rule of optimization club: don't optimize. The second rule: seriously, profile first.
## My code is so efficient, it's lazy. It implements lazy loading, lazy evaluation, and lazy developer patterns.
## Our caching strategy is so aggressive, it cached the bugs too. Now they load instantly.
## I wrote a performance monitoring tool. It's so thorough, it became the bottleneck.
## My code has two speeds: glacial and broken. I'm still debugging the fast mode.
## I optimized my algorithm from O(n²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes all day. I forgot to mention n is measured in billions.
## I spent six weeks optimizing my code to run in 10 milliseconds instead of 50. The user's internet connection adds 2 seconds of latency.
## I optimized my code by 50%. It now takes twice as long but uses half the memory.
## Why do programmers always confuse optimization with obfuscation? Because both make the code unreadable, but only one makes it faster.
## I replaced all my loops with recursion. Now my code is elegant AND runs out of stack space!
## What's a programmer's favorite exercise? Cache invalidation. It's the only thing harder than naming things.
## My boss said our app needs to be faster. So I decreased the timeout values. Problem solved!
## I wrote a performance monitoring tool to find bottlenecks. Now the monitoring tool is the bottleneck.
## Our app's performance is like quantum physics: it changes when you observe it. Thanks, Heisenberg profiler!
## Why do programmers prefer O(log n) algorithms? Because O(n²) algorithms give them too much time to contemplate their life choices.
## I optimized our microservices architecture. Now instead of one slow service, we have 47 slow services that all blame each other.
## My code is so optimized, it runs before I even write it. Unfortunately, that's because it's cached from the last crash.
## What's the fastest way to optimize code? Convince management that slow is the new fast. Call it 'deliberate computing' and charge extra for it.
## Why did the developer's optimization take so long? He was optimizing the optimization process first.
## Our app is so slow, users think the loading spinner is the actual feature.
## I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes 3 seconds. Turns out n was 5.
## My manager said to make the app 'feel' faster. So I added more loading animations.
## I spent three days optimizing a function that runs once at startup. I'm very good at prioritization.
## The bottleneck is always in the last place you look. Mainly because you stop looking after you find it.
## My code is perfectly optimized. It just needs faster hardware, better network, more memory, and lower user expectations.
## Why did the algorithm go to therapy? It had O(n!) complexity and couldn't cope with growth.
## I don't have performance issues. I have 'eventual consistency' with user expectations.
## I finally found the bottleneck! It was the developer. Specifically, me. Writing slow code.
## Our system is so well-optimized, it can handle 10,000 concurrent users. We have 3, but we're ready.
## I optimized my code so much it now runs before I press Enter.
## My algorithm has O(1) complexity. One hour, that is.
## I added multithreading to speed things up. Now my bugs happen in parallel.
## The bottleneck in my application? The developer. I'm still debugging from 2019.
## I wrote a performance monitoring tool. It's so thorough it slows everything down by 90%. Working as intended.
## I spent three weeks optimizing a function that runs once at startup. I'm very good at prioritizing.
## The cache was supposed to speed things up. Now I have fast access to outdated data.
## I don't have performance problems. I have 'extended processing time features' that give users a chance to appreciate the loading animation.
## My new optimization strategy: I measure performance in geological time scales. Suddenly everything is blazingly fast!
## I finally found the bottleneck after six months of profiling. It was the profiler.
## I wrote a script to optimize my optimization scripts. It's been running for three days. Any moment now, everything will be faster. Any moment.
## Our app is so slow, users think the loading spinner is the main feature.
## I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My manager asked why it still takes 5 seconds.
## My code went from 10 seconds to 10 milliseconds. Now I have 9.99 seconds to explain why I spent two weeks on it.
## I added caching to improve performance. Now my cache invalidation is the bottleneck.
## Our server handles 1000 requests per second! Unfortunately, we get 1001.
## I parallelized my code across 16 cores. It now runs 16 times slower because of lock contention.
## The performance improvement was so good, we had to slow it down so users would believe it was actually working.
## My optimization reduced CPU usage from 100% to 2%. Turns out I accidentally commented out the entire application.
## I wrote a script to optimize my code automatically. It's been running for three days. I think the script needs optimizing.
## Our app's performance is like quantum mechanics—it changes when you observe it. Mostly because you turn on profiling.
## My code now runs in constant time O(1). The constant is 47 hours.
## After six months of optimization, our app finally loads instantly. Then we added analytics tracking.

## Our uptime is like Schrödinger's cat: simultaneously 99.9% and 0%, depending on whether management is looking at the dashboard.
## I practice defensive maintenance: I defend why I haven't done it yet.
## Our disaster recovery plan is stored on the server that's most likely to fail. We call it 'optimistic planning.'
## I don't always test my backups, but when I do, it's during an actual disaster.
## The three states of server maintenance: 'It's fine,' 'It's probably fine,' and 'Why is everything on fire?'
## I schedule maintenance during the maintenance window, but the server schedules its crashes for 3 AM on Sunday. We have different calendars.
## Our uptime SLA is 99.9%. The other 0.1% is when we're actually awake to notice the downtime.
## I asked my monitoring system when I should schedule maintenance. It said, 'According to my alerts, you should have done it six months ago.'
## My backup strategy is like my gym membership—I pay for it but never actually use it.
## I named my backup server 'Titanic.' Everyone said it was unsinkable too.
## Preventive maintenance is like flossing—everyone knows they should do it, but most people wait for the pain.
## Why did the database administrator go to therapy? Too many unresolved conflicts and failed transactions.
## I practice defensive maintenance: I assume everything is already broken and work backwards from there.
## Our disaster recovery plan is stored on the server that keeps crashing. I see no problems with this strategy.
## I told my boss we need redundancy for our critical systems. He said, 'No, once is enough.' I told him again.
## Our uptime is like a horror movie—99.9% of the time nothing happens, but that 0.1% will haunt you forever.
## I implemented automated maintenance scripts. Now instead of manually breaking things at 3 AM, I can break them automatically at any time.
## Why did the sysadmin refuse to play Jenga? Because they spend enough time wondering which piece they can remove without everything collapsing.
## My maintenance philosophy: If it ain't broke, it will be soon, so I should probably look at it now.
## I tried to automate my system maintenance, but now I maintain the automation scripts.
## The three stages of system maintenance: 1) It works, 2) It still works but I don't know why, 3) Call the person who left six months ago.
## I don't always test my disaster recovery plan, but when I do, it's during an actual disaster.
## I've achieved 99.9% uptime! The other 0.1% was during business hours.
## Preventive maintenance is what you do the day after something breaks.
## I told my boss we need redundancy. Now I have two bosses telling me the same thing.
## I practice defensive programming. My code is so defensive, it refuses to run in production.
## My patch management strategy is like a game of Jenga - remove the wrong piece and everything falls apart.
## What did the sysadmin say after successfully updating 500 servers without incident? 'I must have forgotten something.'
## The best time to start maintaining your system was five years ago. The second best time is right after it crashes in front of the CEO.
## Our backup strategy is foolproof. We have backups of our backups. Unfortunately, they all failed simultaneously.
## I spent six hours optimizing our monitoring system. Now I get alerts about how well the monitoring system is working.
## Our disaster recovery plan has three steps: panic, call someone smarter, and update your resume.
## How many maintenance windows does it take to fix a critical bug? One more than you scheduled.
## Our uptime is 99.9%. The other 0.1% is when I'm actually trying to fix things.
## I implemented automated maintenance scripts. Now instead of manually breaking things at 2 AM, the script does it for me at 2 AM.
## The best time to test your backups is right after you need them. The second best time is never, apparently.
## My server maintenance philosophy is simple: if it ain't broke, wait five minutes.
## I ran a disk cleanup utility and freed up 2GB of space. The system immediately filled it with logs about how much space I freed.
## My backup strategy is like my gym membership - I pay for it religiously but never actually use it.
## Preventive maintenance: fixing things that aren't broken yet so you can break them properly.
## I told my boss we need a disaster recovery plan. He said 'We have one - panic and blame the intern.'
## Scheduled maintenance window: a time when you discover all the dependencies nobody documented.
## Patch Tuesday: the day when we fix last month's fixes that fixed last year's fixes.
## Why do maintenance scripts always run perfectly in testing? Because production is where they go to find their true calling: chaos.
## The lifecycle of a backup: Created with hope, stored with pride, tested never, needed desperately, found corrupted.
## I ran `sudo apt-get install discipline` but my servers still crash at 3 AM.
## My backup strategy is called 'hope.' It's not working out.
## The best time to fix a bug is before the CEO notices it. The second best time is now.
## Our disaster recovery plan is stored on the server that keeps crashing.
## I don't always test my backups, but when I do, it's during a crisis.
## The three states of system maintenance: working, broken, and 'don't touch it, nobody knows why it works.'
## My server monitoring system has three alerts: green for 'working,' yellow for 'probably working,' and red for 'update your resume.'
## Why did the sysadmin refuse to play Jenga? He said 'I deal with enough single points of failure at work.'
## I asked the senior engineer how to prevent system failures. He handed me his resignation letter from 2015 and said 'I tried.'
## My preventive maintenance schedule has three phases: panic, denial, and emergency intervention.
## The best part about our monitoring system is that it crashes right before the servers do, so we never get false alarms.
## I've achieved true DevOps enlightenment: I now break things in production intentionally, call it 'chaos engineering,' and get praised for it.
## I learned HTML in a day. Then I spent three years learning why my divs won't center.

## Student: 'Can I use Stack Overflow on the exam?' Professor: 'Sure, but it's closed-book.' Student: 'Perfect, that's the only status I know.'
## My first code review felt like showing my diary to a grammar nazi who also happens to be a perfectionist robot.
## Teaching programming to beginners is like explaining color to someone by only using the RGB values.
## Why do students love Python? Because it's the only language where whitespace errors feel like a personal attack.

## My test coverage report is like a report card that only shows the questions I didn't answer.
## Continuous integration tools are just robots that judge your work every time you think you're done, ensuring you're never actually done.
## I told my IDE I needed space. Now it just adds more whitespace to my code.
## Why don't memory profilers make good friends? They're always bringing up the past.
