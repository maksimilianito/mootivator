- text: "Mobile developers don't have bugs, they have 'device-specific features'."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common excuse developers make when software behaves differently across various mobile devices. It's a simple statement that subverts the typical 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' defense by adding the mobile-specific context of fragmentation."

- text: "Why did the mobile app go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses a double meaning - 'dependencies' refers both to technical package dependencies in mobile development and psychological emotional dependencies, creating incongruity through applying technical terminology to human emotional situations."

- text: "I told my app it needed to lose weight. Now it's 2MB and crashes constantly."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the tension between app size optimization and functionality, personifying the app as going on an extreme diet with negative consequences - a relatable scenario applied to software."

- text: "Android and iOS developers walk into a bar. They sit at separate tables."
  explanation: "This plays on the rivalry and incompatibility between the two major mobile platforms, using the classic 'walks into a bar' setup but subverting expectations by having them not interact at all."

- text: "My mobile app supports all devices. Both of them."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection - starting with a boastful claim about universal compatibility, then revealing the developer only tested on two devices, highlighting the reality of limited testing resources."

- text: "Why don't mobile developers trust the cloud? Too many suspended states."
  explanation: "This creates humor through double meaning - 'suspended states' refers both to app lifecycle states in mobile development and the unreliability of cloud services, plus the paranoia developers feel about both."

- text: "I spent three days debugging. Turns out I was testing on the wrong device."
  explanation: "This is a relatable frustration story that many mobile developers have experienced - the relief theory at work, allowing developers to laugh at a common painful mistake."

- text: "Mobile development: where 'it works on my phone' is both a guarantee and a warning."
  explanation: "This paradoxical statement captures the essence of mobile fragmentation - the same phrase can mean opposite things depending on context, highlighting the unpredictability of cross-device compatibility."

- text: "Why did the iOS developer break up with the Android developer? Incompatible lifecycles."
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of different app lifecycle management between platforms to a romantic relationship, using the superiority of technical knowledge to create humor about platform differences."

- text: "My app has 5-star reviews! All three of them are from my mom."
  explanation: "This combines the setup of success (5-star reviews) with the punchline of failure (only three reviews, all from mom), creating humor through the contrast and self-deprecation about app popularity."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production on user devices."
  explanation: "This riffs on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the terrible practice of using real users as testers, creating humor through admitted incompetence."

- text: "Why did the mobile app go to the gym? To reduce its memory footprint."
  explanation: "This personifies an app trying to optimize itself like a person trying to lose weight, creating incongruity by applying human fitness goals to technical optimization concerns."

- text: "Flutter developer: 'Write once, run anywhere!' Three weeks later: 'Why does this look different on every device?'"
  explanation: "This joke captures the gap between cross-platform framework promises and reality, using the time-based structure to show the journey from optimism to disillusionment that many developers experience."

- text: "My app's battery usage is a feature. It keeps users from using their phones too much."
  explanation: "This turns a major flaw (poor battery optimization) into a satirical wellness feature, using absurdist logic to defend bad code while commenting on phone addiction."

- text: "Why do mobile developers make terrible magicians? They can't make their bugs disappear, they just hide them in different screen sizes."
  explanation: "This uses the magician metaphor to highlight how responsive design can mask but not fix underlying problems, creating humor through the comparison of debugging to failed magic tricks."

- text: "I asked my app to support tablets. It said 'I'll just stretch everything and call it a day.'"
  explanation: "This personifies an app taking the laziest approach to tablet support, a common shortcut developers take. The humor comes from the app's honest admission of doing the minimum work."

- text: "Mobile development is easy! Said no one who's ever dealt with Android fragmentation, iOS review guidelines, push notifications, background processes, memory leaks, and 47 different screen sizes."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-and-subversion structure, starting with a naive statement then overwhelming it with the reality of mobile development's complexity, creating humor through exhaustive listing of pain points."

- text: "Why did the React Native developer cross the road? To prove they could do it without a native bridge. They're still crossing."
  explanation: "This plays on the classic joke format while commenting on React Native's performance issues and the ongoing struggle between cross-platform convenience and native performance, with the extended punchline adding to the absurdity."

- text: "I finally fixed that crash that only happened on Tuesdays between 2-3 PM on Samsung devices running Android 9 in dark mode. The user switched to iPhone."
  explanation: "This joke builds up the absurdly specific debugging scenario that mobile developers face, then delivers the crushing punchline that all that effort was wasted, combining frustration and irony perfectly."

- text: "App Store rejection reasons: 1) Too similar to existing apps. 2) Too different from existing apps. 3) It's Tuesday. 4) The reviewer's coffee was cold."
  explanation: "This satirizes the seemingly arbitrary and contradictory nature of app store review processes, using escalation from plausible to absurd reasons to highlight developer frustrations with platform gatekeepers."

- text: "A mobile developer's prayer: 'Dear God, please let this work on the first try.' God's response: 'LOL. Gradle sync failed.'"
  explanation: "This creates humor by personifying God as a troll who understands mobile development pain, combining religious format with technical specificity (Gradle sync issues), and capturing the hopeless optimism developers feel before inevitable failure."
