- text: "Debugging: because 'it works on my machine' isn't a deployment strategy."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common developer excuse when code fails in production but works locally. It highlights the frustration of environment-specific bugs and the inadequacy of this defense."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A play on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, this joke satirizes the dangerous practice of testing code directly in live environments, which often happens during desperate debugging sessions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning - 'bugs' as both insects attracted to light and software errors. The incongruity creates humor by applying natural phenomena to programming problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It just develops random unexpected features."
  explanation: "This employs the classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' defense mechanism, reframing failures as intentional design choices through linguistic gymnastics that every developer recognizes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurd paradox of investigating a problem you created yourself, capturing the self-inflicted nature of most debugging sessions."
  rating: 9

- text: "I spent 3 hours debugging my code. The problem was a missing semicolon. I'm not crying, you're crying."
  explanation: "This highlights the disproportionate time investment for trivial errors, using emotional vulnerability to express the universal frustration of syntax-related bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "99 little bugs in the code, 99 bugs in the code. Take one down, patch it around, 127 bugs in the code."
  explanation: "A parody of '99 Bottles of Beer' that illustrates the hydra-like nature of debugging where fixing one bug creates multiple new ones, defying mathematical logic for comedic effect."
  rating: 10

- text: "A programmer's wife asks him to go to the store: 'Buy a loaf of bread, and if they have eggs, get a dozen.' He returns with 12 loaves of bread."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the literal interpretation of conditional logic in programming. The ambiguous 'get a dozen' is parsed as applying to bread rather than eggs, showing how programmers think."
  rating: 10

- text: "The best debugging tool? printf(). The second best? Crying softly while rocking back and forth."
  explanation: "This combines technical reality (print statements as debugging tools) with emotional breakdown, using escalation and absurdity to capture the debugging experience's psychological toll."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally found the bug! It was between the keyboard and the chair."
  explanation: "This uses the classic PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair) concept, where the 'bug' is actually user error, creating humor through self-deprecating admission."
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging: Where you spend 6 hours finding a bug, then 6 minutes fixing it, then 6 seconds wondering why you didn't see it sooner."
  explanation: "This uses the rule of threes with decreasing time scales to illustrate the disproportionate effort-to-solution ratio and the retrospective obviousness of bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "My debugging process: 1) That can't possibly work. 2) Why isn't this working? 3) Oh, that's why. 4) Wait, why is it working now? 5) Don't touch anything."
  explanation: "This five-stage progression captures the emotional rollercoaster and superstitious behavior that emerges during debugging, ending with the fear of breaking working code."
  rating: 9

- text: "There are two types of people: those who can extrapolate from incomplete data, and"
  explanation: "This meta-joke about debugging incomplete information leaves the second type unstated, forcing the reader to extrapolate, thereby proving they're the first type. It's recursive humor about problem-solving."
  rating: 10

- text: "I don't need a debugger. I have console.log() and trust issues."
  explanation: "This combines the primitive debugging technique with psychological damage, suggesting that extensive debugging has created paranoia, making humor from trauma and technical reality."
  rating: 9

- text: "The code was working yesterday. I didn't change anything. Except for those 47 commits."
  explanation: "This captures the cognitive dissonance of denying responsibility while simultaneously admitting to extensive changes, highlighting the self-deception common in debugging."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging is 90% understanding the problem, 5% fixing it, and 5% wondering why your fix worked when it absolutely shouldn't have."
  explanation: "This breaks down the debugging process into percentages that don't match expectations, with the final category capturing the unsettling mystery of accidental solutions."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote a recursive debugging function. Now I'm stuck debugging the debugger debugging the debugger debugging the..."
  explanation: "This creates humor through infinite recursion applied to debugging itself, making the meta-problem more complex than the original bug, which is absurdly relatable."
  rating: 7

- text: "The worst part of debugging isn't finding the bug. It's explaining to the rubber duck why you've been talking to it for three hours."
  explanation: "This references rubber duck debugging (explaining code to an inanimate object) and creates humor from the social awkwardness of being caught using this legitimate technique."
  rating: 8

- text: "Senior developer's debugging strategy: Delete everything, start over. Junior developer's debugging strategy: Add print statements until something makes sense. My strategy: Panic, then implement both."
  explanation: "This contrasts two stereotypical approaches with a third that combines them through panic, creating humor through escalation and the admission that experience doesn't eliminate fear."
  rating: 7

- text: "I found a bug that only appears on Tuesdays between 2-3 PM when the user's name starts with 'Q'. This is why I drink."
  explanation: "This presents an absurdly specific, nearly impossible-to-reproduce bug that captures the nightmare scenario of race conditions and edge cases, justifying substance use through hyperbole."
  rating: 9

- text: "Debugging is the art of removing bugs. Programming is the art of introducing them in the first place. I'm a master of both, which is why I'm trapped in an eternal loop of my own creation, slowly going insane while my rubber duck judges me silently."
  explanation: "This escalates from simple definition to existential crisis, combining self-awareness, cyclical futility, psychological breakdown, and the silent judgment of debugging tools into a crescendo of technical despair that perfectly captures the debugging experience."
