- text: My router has trust issues—it keeps asking "Are you sure?" every time I try to configure it.
  explanation: This joke uses personification to attribute human psychological traits (trust issues) to a networking device. The humor comes from the incongruity of treating the router's standard confirmation dialogs as emotional insecurity, while also reflecting the genuine frustration users feel with repetitive confirmation prompts.
  rating: 7

- text: Why don't networks ever win at poker? Because they always show their hand in the packet header.
  explanation: This joke plays on the double meaning of "showing your hand"—both a poker term for revealing your cards prematurely and the technical reality that network packets contain visible header information. The incongruity lies in applying gambling strategy to network protocols.

- text: I named my WiFi "404 Network Unavailable" so my neighbors think they have connection problems.
  explanation: This joke combines mischief with technical knowledge. The humor stems from exploiting the familiarity of the "404 Not Found" error to create confusion, playing on the superiority theory where the joke-teller is cleverly deceiving others.

- text: The cloud is just someone else's computer having a really good day.
  explanation: This joke deconstructs the mystique of "cloud computing" by reducing it to its literal reality—remote servers. The humor comes from the anthropomorphization ("having a good day") and the deflation of marketing buzzwords into mundane reality.
  rating: 8

- text: Why did the TCP packet go to therapy? It had abandonment issues and needed constant acknowledgment.
  explanation: This personifies the TCP protocol's requirement for ACK (acknowledgment) packets as psychological neediness. The joke works on multiple levels—technical accuracy about TCP's reliability mechanism and the human tendency to need validation.

- text: My ISP promised me "blazing fast" speeds. Turns out they meant my router would literally catch fire.
  explanation: This joke uses misdirection by taking marketing hyperbole literally. The setup creates an expectation of high performance, while the punchline delivers physical combustion—a common complaint about overheating networking equipment.
  rating: 7

- text: Ping is just the internet's way of asking "Are you still there?" like an anxious friend at 2 AM.
  explanation: This humanizes the ping command as social anxiety, creating humor through the incongruity of comparing a diagnostic network tool to needy human behavior. It resonates with anyone who's experienced either situation.
  rating: 8

- text: I told my firewall a joke, but it blocked the punchline for security reasons.
  explanation: This meta-joke plays on firewall behavior (blocking content) interfering with joke structure itself. The self-referential nature creates humor by having the security mechanism prevent the very thing that would complete the joke.

- text: Why do network engineers make terrible comedians? Their jokes have too much latency—you get the punchline three seconds after the setup.
  explanation: This applies the technical concept of network latency (delay) to comedic timing, which requires precise synchronization. The incongruity of using network performance metrics to explain failed humor creates the comedic effect.
  rating: 8

- text: HTTP and HTTPS walked into a bar. The bartender served HTTPS first because it had better credentials.
  explanation: This joke anthropomorphizes web protocols and uses the double meaning of "credentials"—both authentication certificates in HTTPS and personal qualifications. It's a pun that works on technical and social levels.
  rating: 7

- text: My home network is like my family—too many devices trying to talk at once, and nobody's listening to the router.
  explanation: This creates a parallel between network congestion and family dynamics, with the router cast as the ignored authority figure. The humor comes from the unexpected but accurate comparison between technical and social chaos.
  rating: 8

- text: Why did the packet get lost? It followed Apple Maps instead of the routing table.
  explanation: This combines network routing concepts with pop culture references to Apple Maps' notorious early navigation problems. The joke works through substituting proper network protocols with a famously unreliable alternative.
  rating: 6

- text: I asked my DNS server for directions. It said "I don't know, but I know someone who might know someone who knows."
  explanation: This perfectly captures how DNS recursion works—servers querying other servers in a chain. The humor comes from describing technical protocol as social networking gossip, making the abstract concrete and relatable.
  rating: 9

- text: Bandwidth is like pizza—no matter how much you have, you always wish you had more, and someone's always hogging it.
  explanation: This uses a universally relatable analogy (pizza sharing) to explain network resource contention. The dual nature of never having enough and unfair distribution creates humor through recognition.
  rating: 7

- text: Why don't UDP packets ever get invited to parties? They show up without confirming, leave without saying goodbye, and don't care if you got their message.
  explanation: This personifies UDP's connectionless, unreliable nature as socially inappropriate behavior. The technical accuracy (no handshake, no acknowledgment) maps perfectly onto rude party etiquette, creating layered humor.
  rating: 10

- text: My ISP's "unlimited data" plan is like an all-you-can-eat buffet where they slow down your fork after the first plate.
  explanation: This joke exposes the deceptive practice of throttling through a perfect physical analogy. The absurdist image of a mechanically slowed fork creates humor while making a pointed critique about false advertising.
  rating: 9

- text: A network engineer's spouse says "You never listen to me!" The engineer replies "Can you repeat that? I think we have packet loss."
  explanation: This joke creates humor by having the engineer misapply technical diagnosis to relationship problems, suggesting they're so immersed in networking that they can't separate professional and personal contexts—a classic nerd stereotype executed well.
  rating: 8

- text: Why did the subnet mask go to the party alone? Because it couldn't find anyone in its range.
  explanation: This uses the technical concept of subnet ranges (which IPs can communicate) as a metaphor for social compatibility and loneliness. The pun on "range" works both technically and socially.
  rating: 7

- text: I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it, and I honestly don't care if you do.
  explanation: This meta-joke embodies UDP's characteristics in its own structure—no guarantee of delivery, no acknowledgment needed. The joke performs what it describes, creating self-referential humor that works on multiple levels.
  rating: 10

- text: The internet is 90% cat videos, 5% arguments, 3% shopping, and 2% people lying about percentages.
  explanation: This joke uses the setup of statistical breakdown to create expectations, then breaks the fourth wall by acknowledging its own falseness. The self-aware humor combined with accurate cultural observation makes it effective.
  rating: 8

- text: A network packet walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender says "Sorry, we don't serve fragments here." The packet replies "Don't worry, I'll reassemble myself after a few drinks."
  explanation: This sophisticated joke plays on packet fragmentation and reassembly while creating an absurdist scenario where the technical process becomes alcoholic behavior. The multilayered wordplay and unexpected application of networking concepts to bar culture creates rich, technically accurate humor.
