- text: "I always read the terms and conditions before clicking 'Accept'."
  explanation: "This is ironic humor because virtually no one actually reads terms and conditions, yet we all agree to them. The joke lies in the absurdity of claiming to do something that's ethically correct but practically never done."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the programmer feel guilty? He used cookies without asking permission."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'cookies' - both the tracking technology and the food item. It highlights the ethical concern about digital privacy and consent in a simple, relatable way."
  rating: 5

- text: "My AI is so ethical, it asks permission before learning from my mistakes."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity by applying human consent concepts to machine learning, where AI typically learns from data without explicit permission for each learning instance."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying our data collection is invasive, but our privacy policy needs a trigger warning."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to comment on how lengthy and concerning privacy policies have become, suggesting they're so alarming they need warnings about the warnings."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't hackers ever win at poker? They always show their hand in the terms of service."
  explanation: "This subverts expectations by suggesting that ethical disclosure requirements force even hackers to be transparent, playing with the contradiction between hacking and transparency."
  rating: 6

- text: "My password manager is so secure, even I can't access my accounts anymore. Perfect security achieved!"
  explanation: "This highlights the tension between security and usability through absurdity - achieving perfect security by making systems completely unusable, which defeats the purpose."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a data scientist and a data hoarder? A privacy policy."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection to suggest that the only thing separating legitimate data collection from problematic hoarding is documentation, commenting on how thin that ethical line can be."
  rating: 9

- text: "I practice responsible AI development. I blame the algorithm, not myself."
  explanation: "This is satirical self-deprecation that critiques how developers sometimes dodge responsibility by attributing problems to 'the algorithm' rather than their design choices."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our company takes privacy seriously. We have three different departments that don't share your data with each other."
  explanation: "This uses ironic misdirection - what sounds like good privacy practice is actually just organizational dysfunction, highlighting how companies sometimes confuse incompetence with ethics."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the ethical hacker go to confession? He found a vulnerability but wasn't sure if looking was sinning."
  explanation: "This applies religious concepts to cybersecurity ethics, playing with the moral ambiguity of discovering security flaws - is the knowledge itself problematic?"
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote an AI ethics framework so comprehensive that the AI refused to operate, citing existential concerns."
  explanation: "This uses absurdity and recursion - making ethics guidelines so strict that they become paralyzing, with the AI itself becoming 'ethically paralyzed' by overthinking."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a programmer who reads every open source license? Unemployed. There isn't enough time in a career."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to highlight the practical impossibility of being perfectly ethically compliant when modern software depends on thousands of dependencies with different licenses."
  rating: 9

- text: "My boss asked me to implement 'ethical AI.' So I programmed it to refuse unreasonable deadlines. I've been debugging my resume ever since."
  explanation: "This is a story-format joke that uses irony - creating truly ethical AI that protects workers' rights would threaten the programmer's own job, showing the paradox of workplace ethics."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the blockchain developer feel guilty? He finally understood what 'proof of work' meant for the environment."
  explanation: "This has a delayed realization structure, where the technical term 'proof of work' takes on ethical weight when its environmental impact is considered, creating cognitive dissonance."
  rating: 7

- text: "I anonymized the data so well that now I can't figure out if I'm GDPR compliant or just disorganized."
  explanation: "This plays with the paradox that good privacy practices (anonymization) can make compliance verification impossible, highlighting the tension between privacy and accountability."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's an AI's favorite ethical framework? Whatever was in its training data."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke about AI ethics itself - AIs don't choose ethical frameworks independently; they reflect their training, which critiques the entire concept of 'AI ethics' as potentially circular."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my smart home device if it was spying on me. It said no, but then recommended a therapist for my paranoia."
  explanation: "This uses a recursive paradox structure - the device's helpful response actually confirms the surveillance concern, demonstrating the privacy invasion while denying it."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the programmer quit social media? He read his own company's data retention policy and had an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This uses dramatic irony where someone working in tech is horrified by their own industry's practices, highlighting how familiarity with the technical details makes the ethics worse, not better."
  rating: 8

- text: "My new app is completely transparent about data collection. Users can see exactly how we're exploiting them in real-time. Engagement is down 98%, but our ethics score is perfect!"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated satire using the superiority theory - true transparency would destroy most business models, revealing that many tech companies rely on users not fully understanding what they're agreeing to."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally achieved work-life balance in tech: I feel equally guilty about the code I'm writing and the time I'm not spending with my family."
  explanation: "This uses the relief theory to address the impossible ethical standards in tech - the joke provides catharsis by acknowledging that ethical perfection leads to paralysis and guilt regardless of choice."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer died and met St. Peter at the gates. 'Before we decide,' Peter said, 'let's review your Git history.' The programmer immediately volunteered for Hell, saying 'At least there I can claim the environment corrupted my commits.'"
  explanation: "This is the most sophisticated joke, combining religious imagery, technical specificity (Git history as moral record), and the ultimate ethical reckoning. It suggests our digital trail is the modern book of deeds, and we're all so compromised by our commit messages, shortcuts, and technical debt that we'd rather face damnation than have our actual work history examined. The punchline about blaming the environment is perfect because it captures how we rationalize ethical shortcuts in development."
