- text: "My hard drive crashed, but at least it went out with a bang. Well, actually more of a clicking sound."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity between the dramatic phrase 'went out with a bang' and the reality of hard drive failures, which produce a distinctive clicking sound known as the 'click of death.' The anticlimax creates humor through misdirection."

- text: "Why did the RAM stick go to therapy? It had memory issues."
  explanation: "A simple double-meaning joke playing on 'memory issues' as both a technical term for RAM malfunction and a psychological condition, using the setup-punchline structure with technical terminology."

- text: "My computer's cooling fan died. Now it's just a heating fan."
  explanation: "This joke uses logical inversion - when a cooling fan fails, the computer generates heat without cooling, effectively becoming the opposite of its intended function. The humor comes from the absurd but technically accurate observation."

- text: "I told my GPU it was overheating. It gave me the cold shoulder... right before it shut down."
  explanation: "This uses personification and wordplay, with 'cold shoulder' being both an idiom for rejection and a literal reference to the GPU cooling down during thermal shutdown. The misdirection adds to the humor."

- text: "Why don't dead pixels ever get invited to parties? Because they just don't light up the room."
  explanation: "A double-meaning joke where 'light up the room' works both literally (pixels that don't illuminate) and figuratively (being fun at parties). The superiority theory applies as we anthropomorphize the failed hardware."

- text: "My motherboard failed. I guess it just couldn't handle being a single parent to all those components."
  explanation: "This joke uses extended metaphor, treating the motherboard as a literal mother struggling with parenting duties. The absurdity of applying family dynamics to computer hardware creates the humor."

- text: "The hard drive crashed into the partition. No survivors were recovered."
  explanation: "A play on words using 'crashed' (system failure), 'partition' (disk division), and 'recovered' (data recovery), structured as a mock news report. The dramatic tone applied to mundane hardware failure creates comedic effect."

- text: "Why did the power supply break up with the motherboard? It couldn't handle the voltage in their relationship."
  explanation: "This uses relationship metaphor with technical accuracy - 'voltage' works both as electrical terminology and as a play on 'volatility' in relationships. The personification of hardware components adds to the absurdity."

- text: "My SSD failed after exactly one year. Guess it took 'solid state' a bit too literally and became permanently solid."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the technical term 'solid state' by taking it to its logical extreme - a failed SSD that no longer reads or writes has indeed become 'permanently solid.' The wordplay creates the humor through reinterpretation."

- text: "Why don't RAID arrays ever win at poker? Because when one disk fails, they all show their hands."
  explanation: "This combines technical knowledge of RAID redundancy (where disk failures affect the array) with poker terminology. The setup creates expectation about gambling, while the punchline delivers technical accuracy in an unexpected context."

- text: "I asked my computer why it kept blue-screening. It said it was just feeling a little blue. Then it crashed before I could respond."
  explanation: "This uses personification and the double meaning of 'blue' (the Blue Screen of Death and emotional sadness). The interruption of the conversation by another crash adds a layer of meta-humor and timing."

- text: "My graphics card died during a gaming session. At least it died doing what it loved: rendering its last frame at 2 FPS."
  explanation: "This joke uses mock-heroic tone to describe hardware failure, with the ironic twist that the card was already failing (2 FPS) when it died. The sentimentality applied to hardware creates absurdist humor."

- text: "Why did the CPU refuse to overclock? It had already reached its breaking point. Literally. There's thermal paste everywhere."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection - starting with a metaphorical 'breaking point' (emotional limit) and revealing a literal breaking point (physical failure). The visual image of thermal paste adds to the comedic impact."

- text: "My network card stopped working. When I asked what happened, my computer said it just needed some space. So I gave it 500GB. Still didn't help."
  explanation: "This exploits the double meaning of 'space' (personal space vs. storage space) and includes the absurd literalization of the misunderstanding. The failed solution adds to the humor through logical but incorrect problem-solving."

- text: "Why don't capacitors ever retire? They keep working until they literally explode. Then they get a severance package all over the motherboard."
  explanation: "This joke uses dark workplace humor applied to hardware failure. Capacitors are notorious for exploding when they fail, and the 'severance package' wordplay (both termination payment and physical separation) creates layered humor."

- text: "My keyboard's spacebar broke. Now all my words run together. My computer suggested I just learn to code in Python - apparently whitespace errors are a feature there."
  explanation: "This joke combines hardware failure with programming language humor. Python's sensitivity to whitespace creates an ironic situation where a broken spacebar would be particularly problematic, adding technical depth to the humor."

- text: "The BIOS chip failed and my computer forgot how to boot. I tried to remind it, but apparently you can't just 'turn it off and on again' when the thing that turns it on is what's broken. That's what I call a recursive hardware failure."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the irony of the classic IT solution ('turn it off and on again') being impossible when the boot system itself fails. The 'recursive failure' adds technical sophistication and self-referential humor."

- text: "Why did the hard drive go to the gym? It wanted to increase its spin rate. Instead, it threw out its actuator arm and now it just clicks at people judgmentally."
  explanation: "This uses extended personification and absurdist logic. The progression from motivation (exercise) to injury (actuator arm failure) to personality change (judgmental clicking) creates escalating humor through anthropomorphization."

- text: "My monitor's backlight died, but the LCD still works. So now I have a screen that only displays images in direct sunlight. I call it 'solar-powered computing' and pretend it's an eco-friendly feature. My boss called it 'unemployed computing' when I missed the video conference."
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'it's a feature, not a bug' pattern with escalating absurdity. The attempt to reframe failure as innovation, followed by the reality check from the boss, creates humor through the collision of optimism and consequence."

- text: "I opened my computer to find the thermal paste had completely dried out. The CPU and heatsink were having a long-distance relationship. I tried couples therapy, but they said they needed someone who could handle the heat. So I applied new thermal paste. Now they're inseparable again. At least until the next thermal failure in 5-7 years."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor treats computer maintenance as relationship counseling, with multiple layers of wordplay ('handle the heat,' 'inseparable'). The cyclical nature of hardware maintenance becomes a commentary on relationship patterns, creating sophisticated absurdist humor."

- text: "My computer had cascading hardware failures: first the cooling fan, then the CPU from overheating, then the power supply from the load, then the motherboard from the power surge, then my will to live from the repair estimate. The technician called it 'the domino effect.' I called it 'the money pit effect.' My wife called it 'I told you so about buying the cheapest components.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating catastrophe with multiple perspectives, building from technical failure to emotional failure to relationship dynamics. The progression from technical terminology to colloquial expressions to domestic reality creates layered humor that resonates on multiple levels, combining incongruity theory, relief theory, and social commentary."
