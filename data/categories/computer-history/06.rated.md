- text: "Grace Hopper found a moth in a computer and called it a 'bug.' Now we have millions of bugs and no moths."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the famous origin story of the term 'bug' in computing, contrasting the literal moth Grace Hopper documented in 1947 with today's software bugs that are purely metaphorical, creating irony through the inversion of the original meaning."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the ENIAC go to therapy? It had too many tubes to process."
  explanation: "This uses anthropomorphization of the ENIAC computer, which had 17,468 vacuum tubes, creating a pun on 'process' (both emotional processing and computer processing) while referencing the complexity of early computing hardware."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first computer bug was actually documented. Every bug since then has been 'working as intended.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory to mock modern software development practices, contrasting the honest documentation of the first literal bug with the common excuse developers use today to avoid admitting mistakes."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did Alan Turing's machine stop? It couldn't decide if it would stop."
  explanation: "This references the Halting Problem, one of Turing's most famous theoretical contributions, creating a recursive paradox where the joke's subject becomes its own obstacle—a classic example of meta-humor in computer science."
  rating: 9

- text: "In 1969, we sent humans to the moon with 4KB of RAM. Today, I need 8GB to open a PDF."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity theory to highlight the paradox of technological progress, where despite exponentially more powerful hardware, simple tasks seem to require absurdly more resources than literally landing on the moon."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to learn COBOL? He said, 'I don't want to become a fossil.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'fossil'—both something ancient and a person stuck in the past—while referencing COBOL's status as a legacy language still running critical systems despite being decades old."
  rating: 5

- text: "The Y2K bug taught us an important lesson: procrastination works if you wait long enough for someone else to panic."
  explanation: "This joke uses relief theory to address the massive Y2K crisis preparation, suggesting a cynical but relatable approach to problem-solving where collective panic eventually forces action."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never get along? Too many Windows between them and Reality."
  explanation: "This creates a triple pun on 'Windows' (Microsoft's OS), 'Reality' (suggesting Apple's reality distortion field), and the metaphorical barriers between the two tech giants, using wordplay to capture their legendary rivalry."
  rating: 7

- text: "A time traveler from 1995 asks, 'Is the Internet still loading?' We reply, 'Yes, but now we call it 'buffering' and blame Netflix.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses temporal context to show how the same frustration (waiting for content) has evolved in terminology but not in essence, highlighting that despite technological advances, some problems persist."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did Ada Lovelace write the first computer program before computers existed? She wanted to debug the future."
  explanation: "This celebrates Ada Lovelace's visionary work by creating a temporal paradox—she wrote algorithms for Babbage's Analytical Engine that was never built, essentially 'debugging' a future that hadn't happened yet."
  rating: 8

- text: "In the 1980s, we had 640KB of memory and it was enough. Now I have 64GB and Chrome says, 'Hold my tabs.'"
  explanation: "This references Bill Gates' famous (possibly apocryphal) quote about 640KB being enough for anyone, using personification of Chrome to highlight how modern software has expanded to fill all available resources, no matter how large."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the mainframe go to a support group? It had terminal problems."
  explanation: "This creates a double pun on 'terminal' (both computer terminals used to access mainframes and terminal as in serious/fatal) while anthropomorphizing the mainframe as needing emotional support for its issues."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. Now our mice are wireless, but our computers are still made of bugs."
  explanation: "This contrasts the material evolution of hardware (wooden mouse to wireless) with the persistent nature of software bugs, using the incongruity between physical progress and metaphorical stagnation for humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Commodore 64 break up with the Apple II? She said he had too much memory of their past, but he said she was too graphic about it."
  explanation: "This personifies two iconic 1980s computers, using puns on 'memory' (RAM) and 'graphic' (graphics capabilities) to create a relationship drama that references their actual technical specifications."
  rating: 6

- text: "A programmer from 1970 time-travels to today. He sees GitHub and asks, 'So you finally invented a way to track all your mistakes?' We reply, 'No, now we share them publicly.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the evolution of version control from a private necessity to a public collaboration tool, highlighting the cultural shift from hiding mistakes to openly sharing and learning from them."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the punch card refuse to retire? It said, 'I've still got a hole lot to give.'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes punch cards (the primary input method for early computers) with a pun on 'whole/hole,' creating humor through the personification of obsolete technology refusing to accept its obsolescence."
  rating: 5

- text: "Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007. The first app downloaded was probably someone trying to figure out where the keyboard went."
  explanation: "This captures the revolutionary moment when physical keyboards disappeared from phones, using the incongruity between the excitement of innovation and the immediate confusion of users facing a completely new interface paradigm."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the floppy disk go to the museum? It wanted to show the kids what 'save icon' actually looked like in real life."
  explanation: "This creates meta-humor about how a once-ubiquitous technology has become so obsolete that it only survives as a skeuomorphic icon, with younger generations having no physical reference for what they click to save files."
  rating: 8

- text: "In 1969, Unix was born. In 2024, we're still arguing about whether it's pronounced 'data' or 'data.' Unix has no comment."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurdity that despite 55 years of computing evolution, trivial debates persist, while personifying Unix as wisely staying out of pointless arguments—a meditation on what truly matters in technology."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Internet go to therapy? Tim Berners-Lee created it to share information, but now it just shares opinions and cat videos."
  explanation: "This contrasts the noble original purpose of the World Wide Web (free information sharing) with its current reality, using incongruity theory to highlight how idealistic innovations often evolve in unexpected and sometimes disappointing directions."
  rating: 7

- text: "A quantum computer and a classical computer walk into a bar. The quantum computer is both drunk and sober until someone observes it, while the classical computer is just drunk and crashes. The bartender says, 'That's the last time I serve you two—one of you exists in too many states, and the other can't handle even one.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke layers multiple concepts: quantum superposition, the observer effect, computer crashes, and the double meaning of 'states' (quantum states vs. states of inebriation), creating a complex narrative that rewards technical knowledge while remaining accessible through the familiar bar joke format."
