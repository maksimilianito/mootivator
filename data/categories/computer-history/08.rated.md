- text: "ENIAC's operators called it 'the giant brain.' Turns out it was just really good at forgetting things when you unplugged it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the historical nickname for ENIAC (one of the first computers) while highlighting the irony that early computers had no persistent memory - they lost everything when powered off, which is the opposite of what a 'brain' should do."

- text: "Why did Grace Hopper keep a nanosecond in her pocket? She wanted to show people how much time they were wasting in meetings."
  explanation: "This references the real practice of Admiral Grace Hopper, who would hand out pieces of wire cut to the length light travels in a nanosecond to illustrate the concept of speed in computing. The punchline adds a relatable twist about inefficient meetings."

- text: "The first computer bug was an actual moth. The second one was also a moth. The third one was a programmer who forgot a semicolon."
  explanation: "This builds on the famous story of the Harvard Mark II moth incident, creating a pattern that leads to the unexpected twist that human error became the 'real' bug problem in computing."
  rating: 8

- text: "Alan Turing invented the computer. Then he invented the test to see if computers could think. Computers are still trying to pass it. Humans stopped trying decades ago."
  explanation: "This joke references the Turing Test while making a commentary on how computers are still striving for intelligence while humans often don't demonstrate critical thinking, inverting the expected relationship."
  rating: 9

- text: "In the 1960s, 'computer' was a job title for humans doing calculations. In the 2020s, 'human' is a job title for people fixing what computers calculated."
  explanation: "This highlights the complete role reversal over computing history, where humans went from being the calculators to being the error-checkers, showing how our relationship with machines has inverted."

- text: "Why did IBM think nobody would need more than 640K of RAM? Because they calculated it on a machine with 640K of RAM."
  explanation: "This plays on the famous misattributed quote about RAM limitations, suggesting the circular logic that the tools we use limit our imagination about what's possible - a meta-commentary on technological forecasting."
  rating: 8

- text: "The Y2K bug taught us an important lesson: always plan for the future. We learned it in 1999."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the irony that the Y2K problem was caused by not planning ahead, and we only learned to plan ahead when it was almost too late, showing the reactive nature of tech problem-solving."
  rating: 7

- text: "What did the punch card say to the programmer? 'Don't fold, spindle, or mutilate me.' The programmer replied, 'Too late, I already did all three.'"
  explanation: "This references the famous warning printed on punch cards, the primary data storage method in early computing. The humor comes from the programmer's casual admission of destroying the very medium they needed to work with."

- text: "Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built a computer in a garage. Now everyone builds apps in coffee shops. Inflation even affected workspaces."
  explanation: "This traces the evolution of tech entrepreneurship culture, from the legendary Apple garage origin story to modern startup culture, framing it through the lens of economic inflation in a unexpected way."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did Dennis Ritchie create C? Because B wasn't good enough, and he didn't want to wait for someone else to invent D."
  explanation: "This plays on the actual history of the C programming language, which evolved from B (which came from BCPL). The joke suggests impatience as a motivation, which humorously simplifies the complex technical reasons for creating new languages."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. The first computer crash also involved wood. Coincidence? I think not."
  explanation: "This creates a false causation between the wooden mouse invented by Douglas Engelbart and computer crashes, playing on the double meaning of 'crash' and suggesting an absurd connection between hardware materials and software failures."
  rating: 5

- text: "How did programmers debug code before Stack Overflow? They read manuals. How did they stay awake while reading manuals? Nobody knows - they're all still asleep."
  explanation: "This contrasts modern instant-gratification debugging via Stack Overflow with the tedious process of reading documentation in early computing, suggesting the old way was so boring it caused permanent sleep."
  rating: 7

- text: "Bill Gates said 640K ought to be enough for anybody. He was right - it's enough for anybody to realize they need more RAM."
  explanation: "This takes the famous (though disputed) Gates quote and reinterprets it cleverly: the amount isn't enough memory to use, but enough to understand you need more - a play on self-awareness through limitation."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a computer in 1970 and a computer in 2020? In 1970, it filled a room and did one thing. In 2020, it fits in your pocket and does one thing - show you ads."
  explanation: "This uses the contrast between room-sized mainframes and smartphones to make a cynical commentary about how despite massive technological progress, the primary function seems to have devolved to advertising delivery."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did Linus Torvalds create Linux? He wanted an operating system that was free. Microsoft heard 'free' and thought he meant 'free to add telemetry.'"
  explanation: "This contrasts the open-source philosophy of Linux with modern Microsoft's data collection practices, playing on the double meaning of 'free' (libre vs gratis) and making a pointed observation about corporate software evolution."
  rating: 8

- text: "The first email was sent in 1971. The first spam email was sent in 1978. It took humanity seven years to ruin email. We're getting faster - it only took three years to ruin social media."
  explanation: "This traces the acceleration of how quickly humans corrupt new technologies, using specific historical dates to show we're becoming more efficient at making things worse - a darkly humorous observation on human nature."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't computer historians get invited to parties? Because they keep insisting the first computer was actually built by Babbage, and technically the party started when the invitation was sent, not when people arrived."
  explanation: "This plays on the pedantic nature often associated with historians (and programmers) who argue about technical definitions and firsts, comparing it to being annoyingly literal about when a party 'starts' - a meta-joke about precision."
  rating: 7

- text: "What did the Commodore 64 say to the iPhone? 'You have 128GB of storage and you're always full. I had 64KB and stored everyone's childhood.' The iPhone replied, 'Yes, but I have it all on video.' The Commodore 64 crashed from the burn."
  explanation: "This personifies two iconic computers from different eras, contrasting storage capacity with meaningful content, then adds a meta-layer where even the joke's structure mirrors computer behavior (crashing from a 'burn')."
  rating: 9

- text: "How many computer pioneers does it take to change a lightbulb? None - they're too busy arguing whether Ada Lovelace or Charles Babbage should get credit for the socket."
  explanation: "This combines the classic lightbulb joke format with the ongoing historical debate about who deserves credit for inventing computing, extending the argument to absurd levels while highlighting how credit disputes overshadow practical work."
  rating: 8

- text: "The ARPANET had four nodes and changed the world. Today's internet has four billion nodes and changed the world back."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated observation on technological progress and regression, suggesting that while the early internet (ARPANET) was transformative in a positive way, modern internet has somehow reversed that progress despite exponential growth - a commentary on quantity versus quality."

- text: "Why did the quantum computer go to therapy? It had superposition issues - it was simultaneously the future of computing and a $10 million refrigerator that couldn't run Doom. The therapist said, 'You'll feel better once someone observes you.' It collapsed into an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke combines quantum computing concepts (superposition, observation, wave function collapse) with the historical benchmark of 'can it run Doom?' and modern quantum computer limitations, while creating a narrative that mirrors quantum behavior itself - the therapy causing collapse is both a physics reference and a psychological one, making it work on multiple technical and emotional levels."
