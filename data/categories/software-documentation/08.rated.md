- text: "Documentation is like a love letter: everyone says they'll write it, but they never do."
  explanation: "This joke uses a relatable analogy comparing documentation to love letters, highlighting the common pattern of good intentions without follow-through. The humor comes from the universal experience of developers promising to write documentation but consistently failing to do so."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer write documentation? He was trying to remember what he coded yesterday."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the self-serving nature of documentation. The humor comes from the ironic twist that documentation is written not for others, but because the developer himself can't remember his own code, highlighting the complexity and confusion in software development."
  rating: 8

- text: "The best documentation is no documentation. Said no one ever who had to maintain legacy code."
  explanation: "This uses the misdirection pattern, setting up what sounds like a genuine opinion, then completely reversing it with the punchline. It highlights the painful reality of working with undocumented legacy systems."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our API documentation is so good, it almost describes what the API actually does."
  explanation: "The humor comes from the absurd understatement and the incongruity between what documentation should do (accurately describe functionality) and what it often does (vaguely approximate reality). The word 'almost' carries the entire joke."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't developers trust documentation? Because it's always a work of fiction."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'fiction' - both as creative writing and as something untrue. It highlights the common experience of documentation being outdated or inaccurate, making it more fantasy than fact."
  rating: 6

- text: "I found a bug in the documentation. It accurately described the code."
  explanation: "This is an ironic reversal joke where accuracy itself becomes the 'bug' - suggesting that documentation is normally so wrong that correctness is the anomaly. It plays with the expectation that bugs are errors, not correct behavior."
  rating: 10

- text: "How many developers does it take to write documentation? We'll find out when the first one actually does it."
  explanation: "This is a variation on the classic 'how many people does it take' joke format, but the punchline suggests that documentation writing is so rare that we've never observed it happening, making it an unsolved mystery."
  rating: 7

- text: "Documentation: Because 'git blame' doesn't explain why, only who to blame."
  explanation: "This joke references the git version control command while playing on the double meaning of 'blame.' It highlights the gap between knowing who wrote code and understanding the reasoning behind it - which documentation should provide."
  rating: 8

- text: "My documentation has excellent version control. It's still on version 0.1 from 2019."
  explanation: "The incongruity here is between 'excellent version control' and the reality of never being updated. The humor comes from the absurd spin on neglect as if it were a positive feature, highlighting the common problem of documentation rot."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the README file go to therapy? It had an identity crisis - nobody reads it, so why does it exist?"
  explanation: "This personification joke gives the README file human emotions, playing on the existential irony that a file named 'READ ME' is notorious for being ignored, creating a philosophical paradox about purpose and existence."
  rating: 7

- text: "I write self-documenting code. That's what I tell my manager when he asks about the missing documentation."
  explanation: "This joke exposes the common excuse developers use to avoid writing documentation. The humor lies in the recognition of this familiar rationalization and the implicit acknowledgment that 'self-documenting code' is often just undocumented code."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our documentation follows agile principles: it's iterative, adaptive, and permanently stuck in sprint one."
  explanation: "This joke subverts agile methodology buzzwords by revealing that the documentation never progresses beyond the first iteration. It's a meta-commentary on how agile practices sometimes become excuses for never completing necessary work."
  rating: 9

- text: "The documentation says to RTFM. I would, but the manual tells me to read the documentation. I'm trapped in an infinite loop."
  explanation: "This creates a programming-style paradox using the crude acronym RTFM (Read The Fine Manual). The circular reference creates a logical loop, making the humor both technical and absurd while highlighting poor documentation structure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the API documentation win an award for fiction? It had the most imaginative description of what the endpoints actually return."
  explanation: "This extends the 'documentation as fiction' theme by elevating it to award-winning literature. The humor comes from treating inaccurate technical writing as creative writing, highlighting the often dramatic difference between documented and actual behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours debugging, then found the solution in the documentation. I'm now questioning whether I can read."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke plays on the common developer experience of overlooking documentation, only to find it was actually helpful. The humor comes from the exaggerated conclusion about literacy rather than simply admitting to not checking the docs first."
  rating: 8

- text: "Comments in code: 'This is temporary.' Date: 2015. Status: Still in production. Documentation: None."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke tells a story through structure, highlighting three related problems: permanent 'temporary' solutions, ancient code still running, and the complete absence of documentation. The terseness adds to the comedic effect."
  rating: 9

- text: "My favorite part of API documentation is the 'Examples' section. It's where I learn that the previous examples don't work anymore."
  explanation: "This joke uses the relief theory, expressing the frustration of outdated examples. The irony is that the most helpful part of documentation (examples) becomes the most misleading, creating an incongruity between expectation and reality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Writing documentation is like time travel. You're sending a message to your future self, who will ignore it and curse your past self anyway."
  explanation: "This joke creates a temporal paradox where documentation becomes a failed communication across time. The humor lies in the futility of the effort and the inevitable cycle of blame, despite good intentions."
  rating: 9

- text: "The documentation said 'intuitive API design.' I've now been staring at it for six hours. I think their definition of intuitive differs from mine."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the subjective nature of 'intuitive' and the gap between marketing language and user experience. The absurd time investment contrasts sharply with the promise of intuitiveness, creating comedic incongruity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer print out the documentation? Because the error message said 'See docs' and he wanted to literally see if they existed."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the literal interpretation of 'see' versus the intended meaning of 'consult.' The physical act of printing to verify existence is absurd, highlighting skepticism about documentation quality while creating a visual comedy."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our documentation strategy is revolutionary: we document what the code should do, not what it actually does. This way, users have both a manual and a wishlist."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated meta-humor that reframes documentation failure as an intentional feature. The joke works on multiple levels: it acknowledges the gap between specification and implementation, satirizes corporate spin, and absurdly suggests that aspirational documentation is actually a dual-purpose product."
