- text: "Grace Hopper found the first computer bug. It was literally a moth. We've been debugging ever since."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the origin story of the term 'bug' in computing. Grace Hopper's team actually found a moth in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947, and the term stuck. The humor comes from the literal-to-metaphorical transition and the eternal nature of debugging."

- text: "Why did ENIAC need its own room? Because cloud storage hadn't been invented yet."
  explanation: "This uses anachronistic comparison humor, contrasting the 30-ton, room-sized ENIAC computer with modern cloud storage. The absurdity lies in applying contemporary solutions to historical problems."
  rating: 6

- text: "Alan Turing walked into a bar. Or did he? The bartender couldn't tell if he was human."
  explanation: "A reference to the Turing Test, which determines if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. The joke inverts the test, applying it to Turing himself."
  rating: 8

- text: "The first computer programmer was a woman. The first computer bug was a moth. Nature has been trolling us from the start."
  explanation: "This celebrates Ada Lovelace as the first programmer while connecting to the moth incident. The 'trolling' framing applies modern internet culture to historical events, creating humorous incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did punch cards go extinct? They couldn't handle the feedback."
  explanation: "A play on words using 'feedback' both literally (punch cards were one-way input devices) and metaphorically (they couldn't adapt to user criticism). Also references their obsolescence."

- text: "In 1975, the Altair 8800 came with 256 bytes of RAM. Today, that couldn't store a single emoji. We've come far, but have we come ðŸ˜‚?"
  explanation: "This creates humor through extreme comparison, showing how absurdly small early computer memory was by modern standards. The emoji at the end is itself larger than the Altair's memory, making the joke self-demonstrating."
  rating: 8

- text: "Bill Gates and Steve Jobs walked into a garage. Only one of them left with a turtleneck."
  explanation: "This references the garage origins of both Microsoft and Apple while playing on Steve Jobs' iconic fashion choice. The setup suggests something dramatic, but delivers fashion humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "The Y2K bug was humanity's first collective experience of commenting out bad code and hoping for the best."
  explanation: "This reframes the massive Y2K remediation effort in terms familiar to all programmersâ€”the desperate fix-and-pray approach. It acknowledges both the real work done and the anxiety involved."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Commodore 64 go to therapy? It had only 64K of memory but millions of expectations."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the iconic computer while highlighting the tension between its limited specs and its cultural impact. The therapy framing creates relatable modern context."
  rating: 7

- text: "COBOL: The programming language that refuses to die. Like a zombie, but with more government contracts."
  explanation: "This plays on COBOL's notorious longevity in banking and government systems despite being considered outdated. The zombie metaphor perfectly captures its undead status in modern computing."
  rating: 9

- text: "In the beginning, there was FORTRAN. And programmers said, 'Let there be GOTO.' And it was bad."
  explanation: "This parodies Biblical creation language while referencing the infamous GOTO statement debate in programming history. The anti-climactic 'it was bad' subverts the expected religious reverence."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't time travelers visit the 1960s computer labs? Because they can't afford the electricity bill for one calculation."
  explanation: "This jokes about the massive power consumption of early computers while using the time travel framing to create absurd scenarios about computational costs."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. Which explains why early users kept trying to feed it cheese."
  explanation: "This creates absurdist humor by taking the mouse metaphor literally and imagining users' confusion with the wooden prototype Douglas Engelbart created in 1964."
  rating: 5

- text: "Dennis Ritchie created C. Then he created Unix. Then he rested, because he'd basically created everything else by accident."
  explanation: "This celebrates Ritchie's massive contributions to computing while using Biblical creation framing. The 'by accident' part humorously minimizes the intentional influence of C and Unix on modern computing."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the Xerox PARC team so bad at business? They kept giving away the GUI. Literally. To Apple. And Microsoft. And everyone."
  explanation: "This references one of tech history's greatest ironiesâ€”Xerox PARC invented the graphical user interface but failed to capitalize on it, essentially showing it to competitors who built empires with it."
  rating: 9

- text: "The IBM PC used to come with a manual. Now computers come with a search bar. We've replaced documentation with hope."
  explanation: "This contrasts the comprehensive documentation of early computing with modern 'figure it out yourself' culture, suggesting both progress and regression simultaneously."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the ARPANET only have four nodes initially? Because they couldn't find a fifth person willing to admit they were on the internet."
  explanation: "This anachronistically applies modern internet stigma to the early days when being online was actually prestigious and rare, creating humor through temporal reversal."
  rating: 7

- text: "Moore's Law: Every 18 months, computing power doubles. Murphy's Law: Every 18 months, so does the software bloat. They're in a race, and we're all losing."
  explanation: "This combines two famous laws to create a new observation about the futility of hardware progress when software inefficiency keeps pace. The pessimistic conclusion creates dark humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "The first email was sent in 1971. The first spam email came in 1978. It took humanity seven years to ruin a good thing. That's actually impressive restraint."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the inevitability of humans corrupting technology, while the 'impressive restraint' comment sarcastically celebrates our failure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers confuse Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25. This joke is from the 1970s. It's older than most programming languages, yet we keep telling it. That's backward compatibility."
  explanation: "This meta-joke references the classic octal/decimal pun while commenting on its own antiquity. The final line turns the joke's age into a programming concept, creating layered humor about tradition and obsolescence."
  rating: 9

- text: "Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and gave it away for free. Then he watched us use it to argue about whether a dress was blue or gold. He didn't patent it because he couldn't have imagined this was possible."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the massive gap between the Web's noble origins and its trivial modern uses. The suggestion that the absurdity of modern internet culture exceeds human imagination is both funny and painfully accurate, making it a perfect capstone joke."
