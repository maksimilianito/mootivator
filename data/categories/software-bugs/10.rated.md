- text: "My code has a bug. I call it a surprise feature now."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common developer defense mechanism of reframing mistakes as intentional design choices. The humor comes from the incongruity between a software defect and a 'feature,' and the casual acceptance of this rationalization."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the bug report get ignored? It was marked 'cannot reproduce.'"
  explanation: "This uses the classic setup-punchline structure, playing on the frustration of intermittent bugs that only appear in production. The humor stems from the shared experience of developers dealing with elusive bugs that vanish during testing."
  rating: 7

- text: "I fixed the bug! Now three new ones appeared."
  explanation: "This joke captures the hydra-like nature of debugging, where solving one problem creates multiple others. The incongruity between success and failure creates the humor, reflecting a universal developer experience."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a bug's favorite season? Debugging season!"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke that anthropomorphizes bugs while playing on the double meaning of 'season.' It's lighthearted and accessible, using the misdirection pattern where bugs would paradoxically enjoy their own elimination."
  rating: 4

- text: "The QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
  explanation: "This extended joke perfectly captures the difference between testing edge cases and real-world usage. The humor builds through increasingly absurd test cases that all pass, only to fail catastrophically at the simplest real-world scenario. It exemplifies the incongruity theory at its finest."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because bugs are attracted to light!"
  explanation: "A clever double meaning joke that works on two levels: the literal insects attracted to light, and software bugs appearing when code is examined closely. The misdirection from developer preference to actual bug behavior creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code works and I don't know why. My code doesn't work and I don't know why. These are the same picture."
  explanation: "This joke uses the meme format to highlight the existential confusion of debugging. The humor comes from the paradox that both success and failure can be equally mysterious, reflecting the relief theory by acknowledging shared frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation."
  explanation: "This aphoristic joke cuts to the truth about software development: official designation matters more than actual behavior. The superiority theory applies as we recognize the absurdity of bureaucratic solutions to technical problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "Using the famous meme format, this joke plays on the dangerous but relatable practice of insufficient testing. The humor comes from the casual admission of what should be a serious mistake, using relief theory to cope with workplace stress."
  rating: 7

- text: "How many programmers does it take to fix a bug? None, it's a hardware problem. How many hardware engineers? None, it's a software problem."
  explanation: "This classic blame-shifting joke uses the setup-punchline-extension structure to show the eternal conflict between hardware and software teams. The circular logic creates humor through absurdity while reflecting real workplace dynamics."
  rating: 8

- text: "A programmer had a problem. He thought 'I'll use regular expressions.' Now he has two problems."
  explanation: "This joke perfectly captures how solutions can become problems themselves. Regular expressions are notoriously difficult to debug, making this a layered joke that works for both beginners (who find them confusing) and experts (who know their debugging nightmares)."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache!"
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'cache' versus 'cash' that works because both concepts are valuable resources that can be depleted. The wordplay is accessible while being technically relevant, making it work for mixed audiences."
  rating: 5

- text: "There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "This meta-joke lists three hard things while claiming there are only two, thereby demonstrating an off-by-one error in the joke itself. The self-referential humor and technical accuracy make it a favorite among experienced developers."
  rating: 10

- text: "I spent all day fixing a bug. Turns out I was editing the wrong file."
  explanation: "This joke captures the devastating realization every developer has experienced. The incongruity between effort expended and the trivial nature of the actual problem creates humor through shared pain, using relief theory to cope with the frustration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#!"
  explanation: "A multilayered pun combining programming languages with vision problems. The wordplay on 'see sharp' and C# works on multiple levels, while the superiority theory applies through gentle language rivalry humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, patch it around, 127 little bugs in the code."
  explanation: "This parody of '99 Bottles of Beer' perfectly captures the exponential growth of bugs during debugging. The specific jump from 99 to 127 (a power of 2 minus 1) adds technical authenticity while the absurdity creates humor through exaggeration."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This anthropomorphic joke uses database terminology in a social context. The double meaning of JOIN (database operation versus social joining) creates the humor, while the setup creates a vivid mental image."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer."
  explanation: "This metaphorical joke brilliantly captures the paradox of debugging your own code. The dark humor acknowledges that we create our own problems, using both incongruity and superiority theories to make the frustration funny."
  rating: 9

- text: "I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it. I'll tell you a TCP joke, but I'll keep repeating it until you acknowledge it."
  explanation: "This sophisticated networking joke demonstrates the difference between UDP (unreliable) and TCP (reliable) protocols through the joke's own delivery. The meta-humor and technical accuracy make it particularly clever for knowledgeable audiences."
  rating: 10

- text: "The best thing about a Boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by one bit."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the binary nature of Booleans while using the 'off-by-one' error concept in an unexpected way. The technical wordplay and logical humor make it work on multiple levels, showing how constraints can be reframed positively."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code is like my relationships: full of unresolved issues, poorly documented, and I keep promising to fix it tomorrow."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke uses the extended metaphor pattern to compare code quality with personal life. The parallel structure builds humor through each comparison, while the relief theory helps us laugh at our own shortcomings in both professional and personal domains. The universality of procrastination and the specific technical terminology create a perfect blend of relatability and technical humor."
