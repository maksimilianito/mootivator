- text: "My code has a bug that only appears on Fridays. I call it a feature for the weekend."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' defense mechanism developers use, combined with the absurdity of time-dependent bugs. The humor comes from the weak rationalization that something broken is actually intentional."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the bug report get ignored? It was marked as 'low priority' in 2019."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure to highlight the common frustration of bug backlogs in software development, where low-priority issues never get addressed. The specific year adds to the absurdity."
  rating: 7

- text: "I fixed a bug today. Three new ones attended the funeral."
  explanation: "This joke employs personification and the 'whack-a-mole' phenomenon where fixing one bug creates multiple others. The funeral metaphor creates dark humor about the lifecycle of bugs."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of bug? The one that reproduces in production but not in development."
  explanation: "This uses ironic superiority theory - obviously this is the worst type of bug, not a favorite. The humor comes from the painful recognition of environment-specific bugs that are notoriously difficult to debug."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code works perfectly. I just need to find the right universe where the requirements match what I built."
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdity and misdirection to comment on the disconnect between specifications and implementation, suggesting the code is fine but reality is wrong."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do bugs love open-source projects? Free accommodation and thousands of witnesses."
  explanation: "This personifies bugs and plays with the double meaning of 'open' - both the visibility of code and the welcoming nature, creating an incongruous comparison to hospitality."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote perfect code once. Then I woke up and found three syntax errors and a logic bug."
  explanation: "This uses the dream sequence structure to express the impossible fantasy of bug-free code, with the punchline emphasizing that even imaginary perfect code has bugs."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a bug that's been in production for five years? A legacy feature with dedicated users."
  explanation: "This plays on the progression from bug to accepted behavior, satirizing how long-standing bugs become normalized and even depended upon by users."
  rating: 9

- text: "My debugging strategy: change random things until it works, then never touch it again."
  explanation: "This uses self-deprecating humor to describe the relief theory approach to debugging, where superstition replaces methodology once something mysteriously works."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't bugs ever take vacations? They're too busy reproducing in production."
  explanation: "This uses personification and the double meaning of 'reproducing' (both bug replication and the technical term for recreating issues), creating a biological metaphor for software problems."
  rating: 6

- text: "I found a bug that's older than our newest developer. We're keeping it for historical purposes."
  explanation: "This joke uses temporal absurdity to comment on ancient codebases and the fear of touching old code, treating bugs like museum artifacts."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a feature and a bug? About six months and a good marketing team."
  explanation: "This cynically plays with the 'feature not a bug' concept, suggesting that time and spin can transform problems into selling points, highlighting corporate doublespeak."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code has achieved quantum superposition: it's simultaneously working and broken until the client observes it."
  explanation: "This applies Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox to software bugs, using sophisticated scientific humor to describe the uncertainty of code behavior before testing, with the client as the observer who collapses the wave function."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the bug go to therapy? It had unresolved issues that kept getting reopened."
  explanation: "This personifies bugs and uses the double meaning of 'issues' (psychological and ticket system), creating a meta-joke about the bug tracking lifecycle."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This riffs on the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format to sarcastically describe the worst practice in software development, using ironic superiority to highlight a common but shameful reality."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a bug's favorite season? Release season, when they finally get to meet users."
  explanation: "This personifies bugs with eager anticipation for deployment, inverting the developer's dread of releases into the bug's excitement, creating dark humor about inevitable production issues."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code passed all tests. Turns out I was testing the wrong application."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection and anticlimax to describe a situation where confidence is completely misplaced, highlighting the absurdity of false positives in testing."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do senior developers never say 'it works on my machine'? They've learned to say 'it's a configuration issue' instead."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory to show the evolution of excuse-making with experience, suggesting that seniors are just better at deflecting blame with more sophisticated language."
  rating: 9

- text: "I fixed the bug by removing the feature. The client called it 'streamlining the user experience.'"
  explanation: "This is a multi-layered joke using misdirection where the 'solution' is actually feature removal, then adding another twist with corporate euphemism, creating humor through cascading absurdity."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the most honest error message? 'Something happened. We're not sure what. Good luck.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes vague error messages by taking them to their logical extreme of complete uselessness, while paradoxically being the most truthful about the developer's actual knowledge of the problem."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my manager the bug was a Heisenbug - it disappears when you try to observe it. He said, 'So it's fixed?' I said, 'Only if we never look at it again.' He closed the ticket."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses quantum mechanics terminology (Heisenberg uncertainty principle) to describe observer-dependent bugs, then adds layers of corporate absurdity where ignorance becomes a resolution strategy. The dialogue format builds tension through the logical progression of a ridiculous but relatable situation, ending with the darkly humorous acceptance of willful blindness."
