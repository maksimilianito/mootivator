- text: "A user calls tech support: 'My computer says it can't find the any key!' Tech support: 'What key?' User: 'It says Press Any Key to continue.'"

- text: "Tech support's first law: The problem is always between the keyboard and the chair."

- text: "Why don't tech support agents ever win at poker? They always tell users to clear their cache."

  rating: 7

- text: "Tech support is the only job where 'Did you read the error message?' is considered troubleshooting."

- text: "A tech support agent walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll it be?' The agent replies, 'I don't know, what are my options?' The bartender lists 50 drinks. The agent says, 'I'll have water.' The bartender asks, 'Why did you need all the options?' The agent responds, 'Force of habit.'"
  explanation: "This joke mirrors the tech support experience of providing extensive options to customers who ultimately choose the simplest solution. It uses role reversal to show how tech support thinking infiltrates everyday life."

- text: "Tech support's three stages of grief: 1) This should be easy. 2) Why isn't this working? 3) How did this ever work in the first place?"

- text: "Customer calls in a panic: 'I clicked on an email and now there are pop-ups everywhere offering me hot singles in my area!' Tech support: 'Sir, that's not our software, that's your browsing history.' Customer: 'No, I swear it was the email!' Tech support: 'The email from your wife titled Family Photos?' Customer: '...I'd like to speak to a different agent.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating embarrassment and the customer's desperate attempt to blame software for personal browsing choices. The specificity of the wife's email adds another layer of humor, and the request for a different agent caps off the awkward situation perfectly."

- text: "A tech support agent dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'Before you enter, you must answer one question: Have you tried turning it off and on again?' The agent sighs, 'Even here?' St. Peter replies, 'Actually, you've been dead for three days. I just rebooted you. Welcome back to work—there's a queue of 147 tickets waiting.'"
  explanation: "This joke combines the ultimate tech support cliché with existential humor about the afterlife. The twist that heaven is actually just returning to work, and that even death itself can be 'rebooted,' creates multiple layers of humor. It suggests tech support is eternal and inescapable, playing on the field's notorious burnout while delivering an absurdist punchline that reframes death as just another IT problem."
