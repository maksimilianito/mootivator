```yaml
- text: "My profiler says I spend 80% of my time profiling."
  explanation: "This joke uses self-referential irony - the tool meant to optimize your time is itself consuming most of your time. It's a simple statement that reveals the absurd reality of optimization tools sometimes becoming the bottleneck themselves."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer trust his debugger? It always pointed out his mistakes."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'trust' - we typically trust those who are honest with us, but in debugging, the tool that constantly shows us our errors becomes our most reliable companion. The incongruity is that we 'trust' something that makes us feel incompetent."
  rating: 5

- text: "The debugger and I have a love-hate relationship. It loves finding my bugs, I hate that it's always right."
  explanation: "This uses personification of the debugger and creates humor through the asymmetric 'love-hate' relationship where both parties have opposite but complementary feelings. It's relatable frustration packaged as wordplay."
  rating: 6

- text: "I asked my linter for a second opinion. It gave me 47 more problems instead."
  explanation: "This subverts the expectation of what a 'second opinion' means - in medical contexts it's meant to provide reassurance, but a linter multiplies your concerns. The specific number '47' adds absurdist humor through precision."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code coverage tool says I'm testing 100% of my code. My users say otherwise."
  explanation: "This highlights the gap between metrics and reality, creating humor through the incongruity between what developer tools report and what actually matters. It's a commentary on vanity metrics vs. real-world outcomes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't debuggers ever get invited to parties? They're always breaking things up."
  explanation: "This is a pun on 'breakpoints' - the fundamental feature of debuggers. The joke uses the double meaning of 'breaking things up' (setting breakpoints vs. ruining social gatherings) to create a personification of the tool."
  rating: 4

- text: "I finally fixed all the warnings in my IDE. Then I installed a new plugin."
  explanation: "This captures the Sisyphean nature of developer tool maintenance - achieving a clean state is temporary because the ecosystem constantly evolves. The brevity emphasizes the futility and cyclical frustration."
  rating: 8

- text: "The git blame tool should really be called 'git shame' - it's more accurate."
  explanation: "This plays on the emotional reality of using blame tools. While technically it identifies code authors, emotionally it often feels like public shaming. The suggested rename makes the implicit explicit for comedic effect."
  rating: 6

- text: "A developer walks into a bar. The memory profiler says he never left."
  explanation: "This is a memory leak joke disguised as a bar joke setup. The humor comes from applying technical concepts (memory leaks, where objects aren't properly deallocated) to a physical scenario, creating absurdist technical humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "My static analyzer found a bug in code I haven't written yet. I'm impressed and concerned."
  explanation: "This creates humor through temporal impossibility - the tool is so aggressive it's predicting future mistakes. It exaggerates the sometimes-overzealous nature of static analysis tools while playing with causality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer break up with their IDE? Too many suggestions, not enough listening."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the IDE as a relationship partner, comparing autocomplete and suggestions to an overly talkative companion. It's relatable to anyone who's been frustrated by aggressive IDE features."
  rating: 5

- text: "I spent three hours optimizing my build tool configuration. My build now runs in 3 hours and 5 minutes."
  explanation: "This is self-defeating optimization humor - the time spent 'improving' the tool exceeds any possible savings. The specific numbers (3 hours work resulting in slower builds) emphasize the absurd outcome through precision."
  rating: 9

- text: "The only tool that never lies to me is the one that tells me I'm wrong. Thanks, compiler."
  explanation: "This uses philosophical irony about truth and honesty. The compiler's 'honesty' is in rejecting our code, making it simultaneously the most trustworthy and most frustrating tool. It's meta-humor about the developer-tool relationship."
  rating: 7

- text: "A debugger, a profiler, and a linter walk into a codebase. Only the programmer leaves crying."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic 'walks into a bar' setup by having the human be the victim rather than the punchline subject. It captures the overwhelming feeling of running multiple analysis tools simultaneously."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code formatter and I disagree on everything. But we're staying together for the team's sake."
  explanation: "This frames the developer-tool relationship as a dysfunctional marriage, where consistency for others (the team) overrides personal preference. It's relatable to anyone who's compromised their coding style for team standards."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. My monitoring tools have trust issues now."
  explanation: "This riffs on the 'most interesting man' meme format while personifying monitoring tools as having psychological trauma from witnessing production disasters. It's layered humor combining meme culture with developer anxiety."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the performance profiler so popular at parties? It knew exactly where everyone was spending their time, especially the bottlenecks."
  explanation: "This extends the profiler's technical function (finding bottlenecks) to social situations, creating humor by imagining a tool that could identify the awkward people slowing down social flow. It's absurdist technical anthropomorphization."
  rating: 6

- text: "My debugger has seen things. Things that should never compile. Things that somehow work in production. It needs therapy."
  explanation: "This uses horror movie language ('seen things') combined with technical impossibilities to create humor. The idea that a tool needs psychological help from witnessing bad code is darkly comedic and highly relatable."
  rating: 9

- text: "The diff tool showed me what I really changed: 2 lines of code and 847 lines of whitespace. I'm very productive at reformatting."
  explanation: "This exposes the gap between feeling productive and actual productivity by using the diff tool as an objective witness. The extreme ratio (2 vs 847) emphasizes the absurdity of mistaking formatting for meaningful work."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my dependency analyzer why my project was so bloated. It showed me a graph that looked like a family tree from Game of Thrones. Everyone's related to everyone, and most of them are dead."
  explanation: "This uses pop culture reference to visualize dependency hell. The comparison to Game of Thrones' complex relationships and high mortality rate perfectly captures both the complexity and obsolescence problems in modern dependency management."
  rating: 9

- text: "My test coverage tool proudly announced 95% coverage. My QA team proudly announced 95% of features are broken. Turns out we were testing different things - I was testing that my code runs, they were testing if it should."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated humor about the difference between code coverage and actual quality. It highlights the philosophical gap between 'code executes' and 'code is correct' through parallel structure and the reveal that testing execution vs. correctness are fundamentally different activities. The meta-commentary on metrics vs. meaning makes this the deepest joke."
