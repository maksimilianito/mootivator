- text: "My CS professor said I'd never amount to anything. He was using a zero-indexed grading system."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the computer science concept of zero-indexing (where counting starts at 0 instead of 1), creating a double meaning where 'nothing' (zero) is actually the first position, suggesting the student is at the top of the class despite the professor's negative words."

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to lecture? The professor kept talking about higher-level languages."
  explanation: "This creates incongruity by taking the metaphorical term 'higher-level' (referring to programming languages that are more abstract and human-readable) and interpreting it literally as physical height, requiring a ladder."

- text: "Academic honesty policy: You may not copy code from classmates. Stack Overflow, however, is considered 'collaborative learning.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the ironic double standard in CS education where copying from peers is plagiarism, but copying from the internet (Stack Overflow) is considered acceptable or even encouraged, despite being essentially the same behavior."

- text: "My CS degree taught me that P=NP. Procrastination equals No Problem."
  explanation: "This plays on the famous unsolved problem in computer science (P versus NP) by replacing it with a student's equation where Procrastination equals No Problem, mocking the tendency of CS students to procrastinate despite the consequences."

- text: "Why don't CS students ever finish their degrees on time? They're stuck in an infinite loop of prerequisite courses."
  explanation: "This applies the programming concept of an infinite loop (code that never terminates) to the frustrating reality of course prerequisites, where each class seems to require another class, creating a seemingly endless cycle."

- text: "I learned three things in my algorithms class: how to sort, how to search, and how to drop a class."
  explanation: "This joke subverts expectations by listing two fundamental CS concepts (sorting and searching algorithms) followed by the practical student skill of dropping difficult courses, suggesting the class was too challenging."

- text: "CS education is the only place where 'Hello World' is considered an achievement worth celebrating."
  explanation: "This highlights the ironic pride students feel when successfully running their first simple program that just prints 'Hello World,' treating this trivial task as a major milestone in their educational journey."

- text: "My university offers a degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. The difference? About $20,000 in student debt."
  explanation: "This joke uses superiority theory to mock the often-debated distinction between CS and CE degrees by suggesting the only real difference is financial rather than educational, highlighting the cost of higher education."

- text: "Why did the CS student fail the Turing Test? He couldn't convince anyone he was human after four years of coding."
  explanation: "This plays on the Turing Test (which determines if a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence) by reversing it—suggesting CS students become so immersed in programming that they lose their human social skills and can't prove they're human."

- text: "My data structures professor said my code was like a linked list: it works, but nobody knows why you'd choose it."
  explanation: "This uses technical knowledge to create humor by comparing poorly written code to linked lists, which are often considered less efficient than arrays for many operations, suggesting the code is functional but suboptimal."

- text: "CS101: Where you learn that computers are logical. CS401: Where you learn that professors aren't."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the contrast between introductory courses (which teach that computers follow strict logic) and advanced courses (where professors' grading and teaching methods seem arbitrary), using relief theory to address student frustrations."

- text: "I asked my academic advisor if I should take Operating Systems or Networking first. She said, 'Yes.' She's been teaching too much Boolean logic."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Boolean logic where 'or' is inclusive (meaning both options can be true), so answering 'Yes' to an 'or' question is technically correct but unhelpful, showing how CS thinking infiltrates everyday communication."

- text: "Why do CS professors love recursive definitions? To understand why CS professors love recursive definitions, you must first understand why CS professors love recursive definitions."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke that demonstrates recursion by having the explanation call itself, creating an infinite loop that perfectly illustrates the concept it's describing while also mocking how professors teach recursion."

- text: "My university's CS program guarantees you'll learn to code in four years. They never said the code would compile."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection by setting up the expectation that learning to code means writing working code, then subverting it by pointing out that students may learn to write code that doesn't actually run—a common frustration in CS education."

- text: "Group project in CS: where one person writes all the code, another manages Git, and three people attend the final presentation."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the universal frustration of group projects in CS education, highlighting the common pattern where work is distributed unfairly and some members contribute minimally while still receiving credit."

- text: "Why did the CS student get kicked out of philosophy class? He kept trying to prove everything by induction."
  explanation: "This creates humor by showing how CS students become so trained in mathematical induction (a proof technique used in algorithms) that they try to apply it inappropriately to philosophical arguments, demonstrating tunnel vision from specialized education."

- text: "My professor said there are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "This is a classic programming joke that lists three problems while claiming there are only two, thereby demonstrating an off-by-one error (a common programming mistake) in the joke itself, creating self-referential humor."

- text: "CS degree requirements: 120 credits, 4 years of study, and the ability to explain to your parents that you're not just 'good with computers,' you're also unemployable without a GitHub portfolio."
  explanation: "This joke uses relief theory to address the anxiety around CS education by highlighting the gap between academic credentials and industry expectations, where practical portfolio work often matters more than formal education."

- text: "Why do CS students make terrible historians? They think anything before their first commit never happened."
  explanation: "This creates humor through exaggeration by suggesting CS students' reliance on version control systems (where 'commits' save code history) has made them unable to value or remember anything not recorded in Git, mocking their narrow technical perspective."

- text: "My CS education taught me that debugging is twice as hard as writing code. So if I write code as cleverly as possible, I am, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. This explains my GPA."
  explanation: "This joke builds on a famous programming aphorism by Brian Kernighan, applying it self-deprecatingly to explain poor academic performance. It creates layered humor by using logical reasoning to explain failure, demonstrating both understanding of CS principles and self-awareness about their limitations."

- text: "The real difference between a CS degree and a bootcamp? Four years and $100,000 later, you'll finally understand why the bootcamp graduate got hired first—they actually finished their projects."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses superiority theory and social commentary to critique traditional CS education by highlighting the ironic outcome where expensive, lengthy formal education produces graduates who are less job-ready than short-term bootcamp students. It addresses the tension between theoretical knowledge and practical skills while using relief theory to process the anxiety many CS students feel about their career prospects despite their significant investment in education."
