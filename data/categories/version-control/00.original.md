```yaml
- text: "I tried to commit my changes, but Git said I had conflicts. Turns out my code disagreed with itself."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'conflicts' - both the technical Git merge conflicts and the philosophical idea of code having internal disagreements, personifying the code as if it has opinions."

- text: "Why did the developer always use Git? Because SVN made him feel like he was working in a museum."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory, contrasting modern Git with outdated SVN, while also playing on the stereotype that SVN is old and antiquated like museum artifacts."

- text: "My boss asked me to explain our branching strategy. I showed him a tree. He was confused until I said 'Now imagine every branch is a different version of regret.'"
  explanation: "This combines visual metaphor with the emotional reality of version control - branches often represent different paths taken in development, some of which turn out to be mistakes."

- text: "What's a version control system's favorite game? Hide and seek - especially when you're looking for that one commit from three months ago."
  explanation: "This personifies version control systems and plays on the common frustration of searching through commit history to find a specific change."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. That's what 'git revert' is for, right?"
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of testing in production, with the punchline suggesting Git revert as a safety net for bad decisions."

- text: "Version control is like a time machine, except you can only go back to moments you remembered to save."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity theory by comparing version control to science fiction time travel, but with the practical limitation that you need to have made commits first."

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to use SVN? He couldn't handle the commitment without branching."
  explanation: "This is a wordplay joke using 'commitment' in both the relationship sense and the version control sense, while referencing SVN's historically poor branching capabilities."

- text: "Git blame is the only place where pointing fingers is considered documentation."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the command 'git blame' which shows who last modified each line of code, reframing the typically negative act of blaming someone as a legitimate technical practice."

- text: "A junior developer asked me what 'detached HEAD state' meant. I told him it's what happens after your tenth merge conflict of the day."
  explanation: "This uses the relief theory, taking a confusing Git error message and relating it to the mental state of a frustrated developer, creating humor through shared experience."

- text: "My commit messages are like my diary: vague, unhelpful, and something I'll regret reading later."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke compares poor commit message practices to diary writing, highlighting the common problem of unclear version control documentation."

- text: "Why do Git users make terrible historians? Because they keep rewriting history with 'git rebase'."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Git's ability to modify commit history through rebasing, comparing it to the problematic practice of revisionist history."

- text: "I told my therapist I have commitment issues. She asked if I'd tried Git. Now I have merge conflict issues instead."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'commitment' while escalating from one problem (commitment issues) to another (merge conflicts), suggesting the solution created new problems."

- text: "What's the difference between a Git repository and a relationship? In Git, you can actually recover from a bad merge."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses the superiority of Git's technical capabilities over real-life relationship problems, playing on the double meaning of 'merge' and 'bad merge.'"

- text: "A programmer's wife asked him to pick up the kids from school. He replied: 'Can you cherry-pick that commit? I'm in the middle of a rebase.'"
  explanation: "This joke applies Git terminology to everyday life situations, creating humor through the absurdity of using version control language in family contexts."

- text: "Why was the developer always calm during code reviews? Because he knew everything was just one 'git reset --hard' away from being someone else's problem."
  explanation: "This dark humor joke plays on the nuclear option of Git reset, suggesting an irresponsible but technically possible way to avoid accountability."

- text: "I used to think 'trunk-based development' was about elephants. Turns out it's just a fancy way of saying 'we all commit to the same branch and pray.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection with the word 'trunk' and then reveals the anxiety-inducing reality of trunk-based development strategies."

- text: "My code review said 'LGTM' but my Git history says 'force push at 3 AM.' These two facts are related."
  explanation: "This joke implies that the developer force-pushed to hide embarrassing commits before the review, creating humor through the implication of cover-up behavior."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SVN and start dating Git? Because Git supported their need for multiple branches of commitment."
  explanation: "This relationship metaphor joke plays on Git's superior branching capabilities while using 'commitment' in both romantic and version control contexts."

- text: "A developer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Before you enter, explain this commit message: fix stuff.' The developer is still waiting outside."
  explanation: "This joke uses the ultimate judgment scenario to emphasize the importance of good commit messages, with the punchline suggesting eternal consequences for poor documentation."

- text: "What do you call a Git repository with no branches? Lonely. What do you call one with 847 branches? A cry for help."
  explanation: "This joke uses contrasting extremes in version control practices, suggesting that both too few and too many branches indicate problems, with the second scenario being a sign of organizational chaos."

- text: "I finally understood Git when I realized it's not version control - it's a time machine for visiting all your past mistakes in chronological order, with detailed notes on why you made them."
  explanation: "This reframes Git from a helpful tool into an instrument of self-reflection and regret, playing on how commit history serves as a permanent record of all development decisions, good and bad. The humor comes from the existential realization that we've documented our own failures."
