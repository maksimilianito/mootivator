- text: "C++ is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, and everyone thinks everyone else is doing it."
  explanation: "This joke uses analogy and social commentary to highlight the gap between C++'s reputation as a complex language and the reality that many developers struggle with it or avoid it entirely, despite its prominence in discussions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Python: where whitespace is not just important, it's the law."
  explanation: "A simple observational joke about Python's unique syntactic requirement of using indentation for code blocks, contrasting it with most other languages where whitespace is largely cosmetic."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: "A pun playing on the homophone between 'see' and the programming language 'C#', while also referencing Java developers' supposed unfamiliarity with other languages."
  rating: 7

- text: "JavaScript: the only language where you can add an array to an object and get a string."
  explanation: "This highlights JavaScript's notorious type coercion system, where bizarre operations produce unexpected results due to automatic type conversion, a source of many bugs and confusion."
  rating: 7

- text: "I would tell you a joke about UDP, but you might not get it."
  explanation: "A clever meta-joke about the UDP network protocol, which unlike TCP doesn't guarantee delivery of packets, making 'not getting it' both a joke setup failure and a technical reference."
  rating: 9

- text: "Assembly language: where 'hello world' is a senior project."
  explanation: "Exaggerates the verbosity and complexity of low-level assembly programming, where even the simplest programs require extensive code compared to high-level languages."
  rating: 7

- text: "Rust: because nothing says 'I love programming' like arguing with a compiler for three hours about object lifetimes."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about Rust's notoriously strict borrow checker and lifetime system, which provides safety but can frustrate developers with compilation errors."
  rating: 8

- text: "In PHP, the only consistent thing is the inconsistency."
  explanation: "A pointed observation about PHP's historically inconsistent naming conventions and function signatures, where similar functions have wildly different parameter orders and naming patterns."
  rating: 6

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "A personification joke using the SQL JOIN operation as a social interaction, creating humor through applying database concepts to human situations."
  rating: 8

- text: "COBOL programmers never die. They just get recompiled for Y2K compliance... again."
  explanation: "References the longevity of COBOL in legacy systems and the recurring need for COBOL programmers to fix date-related issues, suggesting they're perpetually brought out of retirement."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the functional programmer get lost? Because they avoided state."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'state' refers both to geographical states and the concept of mutable state in programming, which functional programmers avoid."
  rating: 8

- text: "Perl: write once, read never."
  explanation: "A play on Java's old motto 'write once, run anywhere,' commenting on Perl's reputation for producing write-only code that becomes incomprehensible even to its author."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks: 'Could you go to the store and get a liter of milk? And if they have eggs, get six.' The programmer returns with six liters of milk. 'Why did you get six liters of milk?' 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "Demonstrates how programmers think in conditional logic, interpreting 'if they have eggs, get six' as modifying the quantity of milk rather than adding eggs to the shopping list."
  rating: 9

- text: "TypeScript is just JavaScript wearing a fancy suit to a job interview, hoping nobody notices it takes the suit off at runtime."
  explanation: "Highlights that TypeScript's type checking only exists at compile time and all types are stripped away when the code runs as JavaScript, making it superficial safety."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't Haskell programmers ever get invited to parties? Because they refuse to deal with side effects."
  explanation: "A double meaning where 'side effects' refers both to social consequences and Haskell's pure functional paradigm that avoids side effects in functions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Golang: for when you want to write C but your therapist says you need to let go of pointer arithmetic."
  explanation: "Suggests Go is for developers who want low-level control like C but with safety features that prevent the dangerous pointer manipulation that causes bugs."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Lisp programmer get lost in the forest? Too many parentheses and they couldn't find their way out."
  explanation: "References Lisp's notorious abundance of nested parentheses, creating a visual metaphor of being trapped in layers of syntactic structure."
  rating: 7

- text: "Scala: we heard you like features, so we put features in your features so you can abstract while you abstract."
  explanation: "A callback to the 'Yo Dawg' meme, mocking Scala's reputation for having an overwhelming number of language features and abstraction mechanisms piled on top of each other."
  rating: 6

- text: "A C programmer walks into a bar and orders 1.0000000001 beers. The bartender says, 'I'll give you 1, close enough.' The programmer says, 'Perfect, that's exactly what I expected.'"
  explanation: "Satirizes floating-point precision errors in C and other languages, where decimal numbers can't be represented exactly and comparisons require tolerance for rounding errors."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do Brainfuck programmers make terrible friends? Because every conversation requires you to decode what they're actually trying to say, and by the time you figure it out, you've forgotten why you asked."
  explanation: "Uses the esoteric language Brainfuck as a metaphor for incomprehensible communication, extending the language's intentional difficulty to social interaction."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my friend I was learning Malbolge. They asked if I was okay. I said '//+&~%*#@!'. They called a wellness check."
  explanation: "Malbolge is designed to be the most difficult programming language possible, with syntax that looks like random symbols. The joke suggests learning it is a sign of mental distress, and the response in Malbolge-like syntax confirms their concern."
