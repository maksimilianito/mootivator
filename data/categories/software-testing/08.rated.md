- text: "QA found a bug in production. The developer said, 'It works on my machine.' QA shipped the developer's machine to production."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the classic developer excuse 'it works on my machine' by taking it literally. The humor comes from the absurd but logically consistent solution of shipping the actual machine, highlighting the environment-dependent nature of software bugs."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the tester break up with the developer? Too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning - 'unresolved issues' refers both to relationship problems and to bug tracking systems where issues remain unfixed. The joke plays on the tension between QA and development teams."

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd."
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates edge case testing methodology, showing how QA engineers think by testing normal inputs, boundary conditions, invalid types, negative numbers, and garbage data - all things that might break a system."
  rating: 10

- text: "Unit tests are like a relationship: if you don't maintain them, they'll fail when you need them most."
  explanation: "This creates an incongruous comparison between technical maintenance and personal relationships, highlighting how neglected tests become brittle and unreliable over time."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't testers ever get lost? They always follow the test cases."
  explanation: "This plays on the stereotype of testers being methodical and procedural, creating humor through the exaggeration that they apply testing methodology to everyday life."
  rating: 5

- text: "I told my code it had bugs. It said, 'Those aren't bugs, they're undocumented features waiting to be discovered.'"
  explanation: "This personifies code and uses the classic 'feature not a bug' defense mechanism, adding humor by having the code itself make the excuse rather than the developer."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation."
  explanation: "This cynical observation suggests that the only thing separating failures from successes is how you describe them, playing on the frustration testers feel when bugs are dismissed as intentional behavior."
  rating: 8

- text: "A tester's favorite game? Hide and Seek - the bugs hide, and they seek."
  explanation: "This simple metaphor compares testing to a children's game, making the technical work relatable while acknowledging the detective-like nature of finding bugs."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to write unit tests? He said his code was already perfect. The code disagreed in production."
  explanation: "This uses personification and dramatic irony - the audience knows the developer is wrong, and the punchline confirms it by having reality contradict the developer's arrogance."
  rating: 7

- text: "Testing shows the presence of bugs, not their absence. That's why testers are always pessimists."
  explanation: "This references Dijkstra's famous quote about testing limitations, then adds a humorous conclusion about the psychological impact on testers who can never prove something works completely."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote a test that always passes. My manager was impressed until I showed him it was `assert(true)`."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the difference between meaningful and meaningless tests, highlighting how metrics can be gamed and the importance of test quality over quantity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do QA engineers make terrible comedians? They always test the joke to death before telling it."
  explanation: "This applies the testing mindset to an inappropriate context (comedy), creating humor through the incongruity of over-analyzing spontaneous entertainment."
  rating: 6

- text: "The code worked perfectly in dev, staging, and pre-prod. Then production happened. Production always happens."
  explanation: "This captures the existential dread of deployment, where despite all testing, production environments have a way of revealing issues. The repetition of 'production happens' adds fatalistic humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "A developer's code is like their child - they think it's perfect. A tester's job is to be the brutally honest relative."
  explanation: "This uses a family metaphor to describe the relationship between developers and testers, with testers cast in the uncomfortable but necessary role of truth-teller."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the test suite take so long to run? Because someone tested the edge cases, the corner cases, and the cases that corners have edges on."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates thoroughness to absurdity, playing on how comprehensive testing can become exponentially complex when considering all possible scenarios."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Said no one who kept their job."
  explanation: "This uses the 'most interesting man' meme format to set up an expectation, then subverts it with a realistic consequence, highlighting the cardinal sin of untested production deployments."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a tester's favorite season? Fall. Because everything falls over when they touch it."
  explanation: "This wordplay combines the season with the verb 'fall' (meaning to fail), while also playing on the stereotype that testers have a knack for making things break."
  rating: 6

- text: "The three hardest problems in computer science: naming things, cache invalidation, and convincing developers that the bug you found is actually reproducible."
  explanation: "This riffs on the famous Phil Karlton quote about computer science's hard problems, replacing one with the universal tester frustration of developers claiming they can't reproduce bugs."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the QA engineer get promoted? They found a bug in the CEO's presentation. It was a feature request by the time it reached the developers."
  explanation: "This joke has multiple layers: it shows how bugs get reframed as features based on who reports them, comments on office politics, and highlights the different treatment of issues based on their source."
  rating: 8

- text: "A perfect test suite is one that fails when it should and passes when it should. Mine just fails when I'm about to go home and passes during my demo."
  explanation: "This captures Murphy's Law in testing - the frustrating tendency for tests to misbehave at the worst possible moments, creating relatability through shared suffering."
  rating: 8

- text: "They said automated testing would save time. They didn't mention I'd spend that time debugging the tests, updating the tests, maintaining the tests, and explaining to management why the tests are flaky. But hey, at least I'm not manually clicking buttons anymore... I'm manually fixing automation."
  explanation: "This extended joke builds through escalation, listing all the hidden costs of test automation before delivering a punchline that suggests the cure might be as bad as the disease. It's funny because it captures the full irony of automation creating its own workload while technically solving the original problem."
