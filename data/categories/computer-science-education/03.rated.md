- text: "My CS professor said our class had a 50% dropout rate. I guess that's what happens when you teach sorting algorithms before teaching students how to sort out their lives."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'sorting' - both the algorithmic concept taught in CS courses and the colloquial phrase 'sort out your life.' It highlights the irony that CS education focuses on technical skills while students struggle with basic life management, touching on the well-known high dropout rates in computer science programs."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to lecture? He heard the course was about high-level programming languages."
  explanation: "This is a simple pun on 'high-level' which in programming refers to languages that abstract away machine details, but is interpreted literally by the student. It plays on the stereotype of CS students taking things too literally."
  rating: 4

- text: "My university offers a degree in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, the admissions process still requires human intelligence."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through the incongruity between what's being taught (AI) and the outdated manual processes still used by educational institutions. It's a commentary on how academia can lag behind the technology it teaches."
  rating: 6

- text: "Computer Science: where your four-year degree becomes obsolete in two years, but your student loans last forever."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration and the rule of three structure to highlight a painful truth about CS education - the rapid pace of technological change versus the slow pace of debt repayment. The contrast creates both humor and social commentary."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a CS student and a philosophy student? The CS student will eventually get a job."
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke that plays on stereotypes about employability in different academic fields. While somewhat edgy, it reflects common perceptions about the practical value of technical versus humanities education."
  rating: 5

- text: "My CS curriculum had three tracks: Software Engineering, Data Science, and 'I'll Figure It Out After Graduation.'"
  explanation: "This joke acknowledges that many CS students feel unprepared despite their education, and that real-world specialization often happens on the job. It's relatable because it reflects the gap between academic theory and industry practice."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't CS professors ever retire? Because they can't stop recursing through their lecture notes."
  explanation: "This joke applies the programming concept of recursion (a function calling itself) to the behavior of professors who repeatedly teach the same material year after year. It's a gentle poke at academic repetition using technical terminology."
  rating: 6

- text: "I learned more about programming from Stack Overflow than from my entire CS degree. My diploma should just say 'Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V Certified.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses self-deprecating humor to comment on how modern developers rely heavily on online resources and code copying. It questions the value of formal education versus practical, community-driven learning, while using the universal keyboard shortcuts as a punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our Operating Systems final was so hard, three students experienced kernel panic."
  explanation: "This joke takes a technical term 'kernel panic' (a critical OS error) and applies it metaphorically to students' mental states during a difficult exam. It's a clever use of technical vocabulary to describe a relatable academic experience."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include so many math courses? Because they wanted students to understand why their code doesn't work, not just that it doesn't work."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the common student complaint about excessive math requirements in CS programs, reframing it as actually useful for deeper understanding. It plays on the frustration of debugging while justifying the theoretical foundation."
  rating: 7

- text: "My Data Structures professor said, 'Life is like a linked list.' I dropped the class because I didn't want to deal with that many pointers to my past."
  explanation: "This joke cleverly uses the technical concept of linked lists (where nodes point to each other) as a metaphor for life and memories. The punchline works on multiple levels - both the technical meaning of pointers and the emotional meaning of references to one's history."
  rating: 9

- text: "Computer Science education: four years of learning why 'Hello World' is harder than it looks."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony to highlight how CS education reveals layers of complexity beneath seemingly simple tasks. Every CS student starts with 'Hello World,' but the degree shows them the compilers, operating systems, and hardware that make it possible."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the CS student's thesis rejected? It had too many dependencies and the committee couldn't reproduce the results."
  explanation: "This joke applies software development problems (dependency hell and reproducibility issues) to academic research. It's funny because it merges two worlds - the technical challenges of programming with the academic challenges of thesis defense."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our CS department's motto: 'Preparing students for jobs that don't exist yet, using languages that will be deprecated by graduation.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses dark humor to address a real challenge in CS education - the rapid pace of change in technology. It's both a criticism and an acknowledgment of the impossible task educators face in staying current."
  rating: 9

- text: "I asked my CS advisor which specialization to choose. He said, 'Pick the one you'll enjoy debugging at 3 AM for the rest of your career.'"
  explanation: "This joke provides career advice through the lens of programming reality. It's humorous because it bypasses typical considerations like salary or prestige and focuses on the unglamorous but universal experience of late-night debugging."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a CS graduate who actually understands Big O notation? A liar."
  explanation: "This is self-deprecating humor about one of the most challenging topics in CS education - algorithmic complexity. It suggests that even graduates don't fully grasp this concept, playing on the imposter syndrome common in tech fields."
  rating: 7

- text: "My university's CS program was so theoretical, we spent three years proving programs correct and one semester actually writing them."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates the theory-versus-practice imbalance in academic CS programs. It uses the contrast between formal verification (proving correctness) and practical coding to highlight how academia can prioritize theory over application."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS student fail the Turing Test? He spent the entire interview explaining why the test was philosophically flawed instead of just answering the questions."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the stereotype of CS students being overly analytical and pedantic. It's a multi-layered joke that requires knowing what the Turing Test is, while also poking fun at the tendency to overthink simple situations."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our professor said, 'In this class, you'll learn to think like a computer.' Three weeks later, I was stuck in an infinite loop deciding what to have for lunch."
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly applies the concept of infinite loops to everyday decision-making paralysis. It suggests that learning computational thinking has unexpected side effects in normal life, creating humor through the absurd application of programming concepts to mundane activities."
  rating: 9

- text: "Computer Science degree requirements: 120 credits, 4 years of study, and the ability to explain to your parents why you're still not 'good with computers' enough to fix their printer."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the gap between what CS education actually teaches (theory, algorithms, software design) and what non-technical people think it teaches (general tech support). It's relatable to anyone who's had to explain that knowing how to code doesn't mean knowing how to troubleshoot hardware."
  rating: 10

- text: "My CS education taught me two valuable lessons: First, every problem can be solved with the right algorithm. Second, finding the right algorithm is the problem."
  explanation: "This joke uses a classic setup-reversal structure to create a philosophical observation about CS education. It starts with an optimistic premise taught in school, then undermines it with the harsh reality of practice, creating humor through the recognition of this universal truth in problem-solving."
