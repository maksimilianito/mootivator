- text: "Grace Hopper found the first computer bug. The second bug found itself."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the famous story of Grace Hopper discovering an actual moth in a computer, while flipping the agency to suggest bugs became self-aware, referencing how software bugs seem to multiply on their own."

- text: "Why did the ENIAC go to therapy? It had 18,000 vacuum tubes and still felt empty inside."
  explanation: "This uses the technical fact about ENIAC's construction (18,000 vacuum tubes) and applies human emotional problems to it, creating incongruity between massive hardware and existential emptiness."

- text: "The Turing Test was originally called 'Can Machines Think?' Then they met management and renamed it 'Can Humans Think?'"
  explanation: "This joke subverts the famous Turing Test by suggesting that after observing human behavior in corporate settings, the more pressing question became whether humans could think, employing the superiority theory through self-deprecation."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't historians trust early computers? Because they were always changing their story—one bit at a time."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'bit' (both a small amount and the fundamental unit of computer memory) while referencing data corruption issues in early computing."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first programmer was Ada Lovelace. The first debugger was also Ada Lovelace. Some traditions never die."
  explanation: "This highlights the irony that the person who wrote the first algorithm also had to be the first to fix programming errors, establishing a timeless pattern in software development."
  rating: 8

- text: "COBOL: Proving since 1959 that UPPERCASE IS NOT SHOUTING, IT'S JUST LEGACY CODE."
  explanation: "This references COBOL's requirement for uppercase syntax while commenting on how old code persists in modern systems, using the format to demonstrate its own point."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the punch card operator never get invited to parties? Because they were always making holes in everyone's arguments."
  explanation: "This uses the physical nature of punch card programming (literal holes) as a metaphor for being argumentative, creating a double meaning."
  rating: 5

- text: "The Y2K bug taught us two things: panic is profitable, and somewhere, a COBOL programmer is still laughing."
  explanation: "This references the millennium bug crisis and the irony that COBOL programmers, whose skills were considered obsolete, suddenly became invaluable, employing superiority theory."
  rating: 9

- text: "In 1969, Apollo 11's guidance computer had 64KB of memory. Today's smart toaster has more RAM and somehow still burns your bread."
  explanation: "This creates incongruity by comparing the successful moon landing with minimal computing power to modern devices that fail at simple tasks despite vastly superior resources."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did Alan Turing break up with his computer? He couldn't tell if it was really in love or just passing the test."
  explanation: "This cleverly references the Turing Test while creating a romantic scenario, playing on the ambiguity of artificial versus genuine responses."
  rating: 7

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. Which explains why early users kept getting splinters in their workflow."
  explanation: "This uses the literal fact about Douglas Engelbart's wooden mouse prototype and creates a pun with 'splinters in workflow' referencing both physical splinters and workflow interruptions."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why was the UNIVAC I so expensive? Because it came with premium features like 'turning on' and 'occasionally working.'"
  explanation: "This jokes about early computer reliability issues by framing basic functionality as premium features, using modern tech marketing language ironically."
  rating: 7

- text: "Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft in a garage. Steve Jobs and Wozniak started Apple in a garage. Lesson learned: garages are the most expensive real estate in tech history."
  explanation: "This subverts the humble origins story by reframing these garages as the birthplace of trillion-dollar companies, creating ironic perspective on their actual value."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the IBM mainframe refuse to retire? Because it was still supporting systems from 1975, and someone had to remember the passwords."
  explanation: "This addresses the reality of legacy systems still running critical infrastructure while highlighting the absurdity of decades-old technology remaining essential."
  rating: 7

- text: "The Morris Worm was the first major internet virus. Its creator's defense? 'I was just counting how many computers were online.' Turns out, all of them—at once."
  explanation: "This references the 1988 Morris Worm incident where Robert Morris claimed his program was just meant to count computers, but it crashed 10% of the internet, using understatement for comedic effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't time travelers visit the 1970s tech labs? Because they're afraid of being trapped in an infinite loop of 'Have you tried turning it off and on again?'"
  explanation: "This combines the modern IT support cliché with the reality of early computing's unreliability, suggesting this solution has always been the primary troubleshooting method."
  rating: 6

- text: "The first computer programmer was a woman. The first computer bug was found by a woman. The first person blamed for the bug? Also a woman. Some things compile across all eras."
  explanation: "This uses dark humor to comment on gender discrimination in tech by showing how women pioneered the field yet faced blame, with 'compile' as a programming pun meaning 'remain consistent.'"
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did Xerox PARC invent the GUI, the mouse, and ethernet but still lose to Apple and Microsoft? Because they were too busy inventing the future to notice someone was copying it."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated joke about Xerox PARC's famous failure to capitalize on their innovations, with 'copying' being doubly ironic since Xerox made copiers."
  rating: 10

- text: "The difference between a vintage computer and a modern computer? The vintage one has a manual that makes sense and takes up three shelves. The modern one has online documentation that makes no sense and takes up three seconds to ignore."
  explanation: "This contrasts old comprehensive documentation with modern scattered online help, suggesting that despite technological progress, usability has regressed, using exaggeration for effect."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Commodore 64 go to the reunion? To remind everyone that it sold 17 million units when 'going viral' meant your floppy disk was actually infected."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'viral' (modern social media success vs. actual computer viruses) while celebrating the C64's commercial success, creating nostalgia-based humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "In 1983, the internet had 562 computers. Today, my house has 562 computers, and they're all arguing about which one gets to update first."
  explanation: "This creates absurdist humor by comparing the entire early internet to modern IoT device proliferation, with the personification of devices fighting over updates highlighting modern tech frustrations."
