- text: "My router has trust issues—it keeps asking for authentication."
  explanation: "This joke personifies a router by attributing human psychological problems to a technical security feature. The humor comes from treating routine network authentication as emotional insecurity, creating incongruity between technical function and human behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the packet go to therapy? It had fragmentation issues."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'fragmentation'—both a technical term for breaking data packets into smaller pieces and a psychological term for mental disorganization. The double meaning creates the humor through incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my network administrator I needed more bandwidth. He told me to lose weight."
  explanation: "The joke plays on the misdirection between 'bandwidth' as a networking term for data capacity and the literal interpretation of 'band-width' as something physical. The administrator's misunderstanding creates the comedic twist."
  rating: 5

- text: "TCP and UDP walked into a bar. Only TCP ordered a drink—UDP didn't care if it arrived."
  explanation: "This joke relies on understanding the difference between TCP (reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures delivery) and UDP (unreliable, connectionless protocol that doesn't verify delivery). The personification makes technical concepts relatable."
  rating: 8

- text: "My home network is like a dysfunctional family—everyone's connected but nobody's communicating properly."
  explanation: "This creates humor by comparing network connectivity issues to human relationship problems. The incongruity between technical networking and family dynamics makes the joke work on multiple levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't network engineers ever get lost? They always know their default gateway."
  explanation: "This plays on 'default gateway' as both a networking term (the router that connects to other networks) and metaphorically as a 'way out' or path. The pun creates the humor through double meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "I named my Wi-Fi 'Hide and Seek Champion' because good luck finding it."
  explanation: "This joke addresses the common frustration of weak or intermittent Wi-Fi signals by framing it as an intentional game. The absurdity of a network actively hiding creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "A network engineer's favorite dance? The subnet mask shuffle—constantly changing positions."
  explanation: "This creates humor by inventing a fictional dance based on subnet masks (which define network boundaries). The image of someone shuffling between network positions is absurdly technical yet visual."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the switch feel lonely? All its ports were isolated VLANs."
  explanation: "This personifies a network switch and uses the technical concept of VLANs (Virtual LANs that segment network traffic) to create a metaphor for social isolation. The technical accuracy enhances the emotional humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "My network topology is like my love life—it's a star configuration with me in the middle and everything depending on me not failing."
  explanation: "This joke uses star topology (where all devices connect to a central hub) as a metaphor for relationship dynamics. The humor comes from the self-aware recognition of being a single point of failure in both contexts."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the firewall break up with the router? Too many rules in the relationship."
  explanation: "This personifies network devices and plays on firewalls having 'rules' (security policies) that filter traffic, comparing it to an overly restrictive romantic relationship. The technical-to-personal translation creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to explain mesh networking to my grandmother. Now she thinks I'm knitting the internet."
  explanation: "This joke exploits the double meaning of 'mesh'—both a networking topology where devices interconnect and a fabric pattern. The generational misunderstanding and absurd mental image create layered humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A broadcast storm walks into a network. Then it walks into every network. And every network. And every network..."
  explanation: "This joke mimics the recursive, overwhelming nature of broadcast storms (where network traffic multiplies uncontrollably) through repetitive structure. The form matches the content for meta-humor about network failures."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't routers ever win arguments? Because they always have to forward everyone else's packets."
  explanation: "This creates humor by treating packet forwarding (a router's primary function) as a personality trait of always deferring to others. The technical function becomes a character flaw in the personification."
  rating: 6

- text: "My ISP promised me high-speed internet. Turns out they meant the speed at which they raise prices."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection about what 'high-speed' refers to, playing on common customer frustration with ISPs. The setup creates an expectation that's subverted by focusing on pricing instead of bandwidth."
  rating: 7

- text: "How do network cables stay in shape? They do twisted pair exercises."
  explanation: "This is a pun on 'twisted pair' cables (a common Ethernet cable type) reimagined as a fitness routine. The technical term becomes literal physical activity, creating visual absurdity."
  rating: 5

- text: "A network engineer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said, 'Welcome! Your IP is 192.168.0.1.' The engineer replied, 'But that's a private address!' St. Peter smiled and said, 'Exactly. You're not going anywhere.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke requires understanding that private IP addresses (like 192.168.x.x) aren't routable on the public internet. The metaphor of being trapped in heaven with a non-routable address is both technically accurate and philosophically amusing."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the network administrator bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the cloud was down and wanted to check it personally."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the abstract concept of 'the cloud' and the literal interpretation of something being 'down' in physical space. The absurdity of trying to physically access a metaphorical concept creates strong visual humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my network why it was so slow. It said, 'I'm not slow, I'm just practicing social distancing—six feet between every packet.'"
  explanation: "This topical joke applies pandemic concepts to network latency, creating humor through the absurd application of social distancing to data transmission. The personification and contemporary relevance make it relatable."
  rating: 7

- text: "A DNS server walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we don't serve your type here.' The DNS server leaves, comes back as an IP address, and gets served immediately. The bartender never recognized it."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke plays on DNS (Domain Name System) translating names to IP addresses. The metaphor of disguise and the bartender's inability to recognize the same entity in different forms creates layered humor about network abstraction."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why is IPv6 adoption like a family reunion? Everyone knows it's important, it's been planned for decades, there's plenty of address space for everyone, but somehow we all keep making excuses to stick with the old familiar IPv4 and hope someone else handles the transition."
  explanation: "This extended joke captures the real-world frustration of slow IPv6 adoption despite IPv4 address exhaustion. The comparison to family dynamics makes a complex technical and organizational problem hilariously relatable through procrastination and resistance to change."
