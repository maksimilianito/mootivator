- text: "CSS: Making things center since 1996. Still trying."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the notorious difficulty of centering elements in CSS, one of web development's most frustrating tasks. Despite CSS being around since 1996, centering content has remained surprisingly challenging through various layout methods, creating a shared frustration among developers."

- text: "Why do web developers always carry a ladder? To reach the cloud."
  explanation: "A simple pun that plays on the dual meaning of 'cloud' - both the physical clouds in the sky and cloud computing/hosting services that web developers frequently work with."

- text: "HTML is like a relationship. You need structure, but too many divs and nobody knows what's going on anymore."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory by comparing HTML structure to relationships, highlighting how excessive div nesting (a common bad practice) leads to confusion, much like overcomplicated relationships."

- text: "I told my website it needed to be more responsive. Now it won't stop asking how I feel."
  explanation: "A wordplay on 'responsive' which in web development means adapting to different screen sizes, but is reinterpreted as emotional responsiveness, creating incongruity between technical and emotional meanings."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C#."
  explanation: "A visual pun combining JavaScript (a web language) with the inability to see, referencing C# (another programming language). The joke works on multiple levels for developers familiar with different programming languages."

- text: "My website is like my diet. I keep saying I'll optimize it tomorrow."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that compares website optimization (a common task developers postpone) to dieting, highlighting the universal tendency to procrastinate on important but difficult tasks."

- text: "What's a web developer's favorite tea? URL Grey."
  explanation: "A pun on 'Earl Grey' tea, replacing 'Earl' with 'URL' (Uniform Resource Locator), a fundamental web development concept. Simple wordplay that requires minimal technical knowledge."

- text: "I spent three hours debugging my CSS. Turns out I had a semicolon in the wrong place. In my JavaScript file."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection - the setup suggests a CSS syntax error, but the punchline reveals the error was in a completely different file, highlighting the frustration of hunting bugs in the wrong place."

- text: "Web developers don't die. They just lose their cache."
  explanation: "A play on 'lose their cache' (temporary storage that websites use) and the phrase 'lose their cachet' (lose prestige/status), with a darker edge suggesting death, creating incongruity through technical wordplay."

- text: "Why do front-end developers eat lunch alone? Because they don't know how to join tables."
  explanation: "A database joke that plays on 'join tables' - a SQL operation typically done by back-end developers - suggesting front-end developers lack this skill, using superiority theory and technical knowledge."

- text: "My code works perfectly. I have no idea why. My code doesn't work. I have no idea why. Welcome to web development."
  explanation: "This captures the absurdist reality of web development where the same code can behave unpredictably across different browsers and environments, creating a paradoxical situation that developers universally recognize."

- text: "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it."
  explanation: "A pun on 'console.log()' - JavaScript's primary debugging method - and the act of consoling (comforting) someone, creating a double meaning that's both technical and emotional."

- text: "I asked a web developer to build me a table. Six months later, he's still arguing about whether to use CSS Grid or Flexbox."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the analysis paralysis common in web development, where developers debate technical approaches endlessly. The absurdity of taking six months to decide on a simple table layout creates the humor."

- text: "What's the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance."
  explanation: "A sophisticated pun on 'inheritance' - both a programming concept in object-oriented design and the traditional way of receiving wealth from family, working on multiple levels for technical audiences."

- text: "My website loads in 3 seconds. The other 2 seconds are just the cookie consent banner asking if that's okay."
  explanation: "This satirizes the modern web experience where privacy regulations have created intrusive cookie banners that ironically slow down the very experience they're meant to protect, using absurdity and current events."

- text: "Why did the web developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "Another cache pun, but this time playing on 'cash' and 'cache', suggesting the developer spent all their money (or cleared all their temporary storage), with economic and technical meanings intertwined."

- text: "There are only two hard problems in web development: naming things, cache invalidation, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that references the famous computer science quote about two hard problems, but includes three items, demonstrating an 'off-by-one error' within the joke itself - recursive humor at its finest."

- text: "A web designer walks into a bar. And a restaurant. And a store. And another bar. Responsive design is exhausting."
  explanation: "This uses the 'walks into a bar' joke format but subverts it by having the designer enter multiple establishments, metaphorically representing testing responsive design across different viewports and devices."

- text: "My website is so fast, it loads before you even think about visiting it. Unfortunately, that's just the 404 error page."
  explanation: "The joke builds up expectation of impressive performance, then deflates it by revealing the fast-loading page is an error page - meaning the site is broken. The absurdist twist creates strong incongruity."

- text: "Why do web developers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts project managers."
  explanation: "A twist on the classic 'light attracts bugs' joke, replacing bugs with project managers - suggesting project managers are pests to be avoided, using superiority theory and workplace humor that resonates with developers."

- text: "I told my client their website would be done in two weeks. That was in 2019. But in my defense, I didn't specify which calendar system."
  explanation: "This joke combines self-deprecating humor about missed deadlines with an absurdist excuse about calendar systems. It captures the universal developer experience of underestimating project timelines while adding an ridiculous justification that makes the procrastination even more humorous."
