- text: "My code works, but I don't know why. My code doesn't work, but I don't know why either."
  explanation: "This joke uses parallel structure to highlight the common programmer experience of dealing with mysterious bugs and equally mysterious fixes. The humor comes from the incongruity of not understanding success or failure equally."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the bug go to therapy? It had too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "This joke employs a double meaning pattern, playing on 'issues' as both psychological problems and software bug tracking terminology. The setup establishes expectation while the punchline delivers wordplay."
  rating: 6

- text: "Software testing is like looking for a black cat in a dark room. Debugging is realizing the cat isn't even there."
  explanation: "This joke uses metaphor and escalation to capture the frustration of debugging. The incongruity comes from discovering that the problem you're solving doesn't exist where you thought it did."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This joke references the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format while highlighting the dangerous but relatable practice of testing in live environments. The humor comes from the superiority theory - we laugh at this bad practice while recognizing we've all been tempted."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This joke uses personification and technical wordplay, where 'JOIN' has both social and database meanings. The setup creates a familiar bar scene before the technical punchline."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Light mode attracts bugs."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'bugs' as both insects attracted to light and software errors. The misdirection makes you think about preference before revealing the technical pun."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code has no bugs. It just develops random features."
  explanation: "This joke inverts the classic 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' defense mechanism, using incongruity to highlight how developers rationalize unexpected behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "How many programmers does it take to fix a bug? None, it's a hardware problem."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the light bulb joke format while capturing the classic developer tendency to deflect blame. The humor comes from the superiority theory and recognition of workplace dynamics."
  rating: 6

- text: "I found a bug in my code. Then I found its entire extended family."
  explanation: "This joke uses metaphor and escalation to capture the cascading nature of software bugs. The incongruity between expecting one problem and discovering many creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer."
  explanation: "This joke uses an extended metaphor to capture the paradox of debugging your own code. The self-referential nature and role reversal create multilayered humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "This joke employs a homophone pun between 'cache' (computer memory) and 'cash' (money). The setup creates expectation of a financial story before delivering the technical wordplay."
  rating: 5

- text: "A programmer's spouse says, 'While you're at the store, buy some milk.' The programmer never returns."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the programming concept of infinite loops triggered by the word 'while.' The absurdist humor comes from taking a programming construct literally in everyday life."
  rating: 8

- text: "I've got 99 problems and they're all bugs in the same function."
  explanation: "This joke references Jay-Z's '99 Problems' while highlighting the reality that bugs often cluster. The incongruity between expecting diverse problems and finding them all in one place creates humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "The best thing about a Boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by one bit."
  explanation: "This joke uses technical accuracy and understatement to create humor. The relief comes from minimizing the severity of being wrong through technical precision."
  rating: 6

- text: "I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it."
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly captures the nature of UDP protocol (which doesn't guarantee delivery) through self-referential meta-humor. The joke itself demonstrates the concept it's describing."
  rating: 10

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders -1 beers. Orders a lizard. The bar crashes."
  explanation: "This joke uses escalating absurdity to illustrate edge case testing. The humor builds through increasingly illogical test cases before the inevitable failure, capturing the reality that bugs appear despite testing."
  rating: 9

- text: "There are two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "This joke is self-demonstrating meta-humor that lists three problems while claiming there are two, thus committing an off-by-one error. The recursive nature makes it increasingly funny upon reflection."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the bug refuse to be fixed? It was a feature request in disguise."
  explanation: "This joke inverts the usual 'bug vs feature' dynamic by suggesting bugs have agency and hidden motives. The personification and conspiracy-theory tone create layered humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally fixed that bug! Now I just need to fix the seventeen bugs I created while fixing it."
  explanation: "This joke captures the hydra-like nature of debugging through escalation and despair. The specific number '17' adds comedic precision to the exaggeration."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is like being in a relationship: you think you understand what's wrong, you try to fix it, and somehow you end up apologizing to a semicolon."
  explanation: "This joke uses an extended metaphor comparing debugging to relationships, building through stages before landing on the absurdist image of apologizing to punctuation. The layers of meaning and the specificity of 'semicolon' create sophisticated humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It has spontaneous features that appear exclusively during client demos and disappear when you try to reproduce them."
  explanation: "This joke combines multiple frustrating realities: the demo effect, irreproducible bugs, and the 'feature not bug' defense. The elaborate setup and hyper-specific scenario create humor through recognition and exaggeration, while the formal tone contrasts with the chaotic reality described."
