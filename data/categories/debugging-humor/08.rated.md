- text: "My debugger stopped working. Now I have to use console.log like a caveman."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the superiority theory, with self-deprecating humor about reverting to primitive debugging methods when proper tools fail. The incongruity between modern development and 'caveman' methods creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because bugs are attracted to light."
  explanation: "A classic setup-punchline structure using double meaning - 'bugs' refers both to software errors and actual insects, creating an unexpected connection between debugging and pest control."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while highlighting the dangerous practice of production debugging, using misdirection to create humor from a stressful reality."
  rating: 9

- text: "The best debugger is a good night's sleep."
  explanation: "This aphorism subverts expectations by suggesting rest as a debugging tool rather than technical solutions, reflecting the relief theory where stepping away often solves problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "A pun on 'cache' (computer memory) and 'cash' (money), using double meaning to connect programming concepts with everyday life situations."
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor and the incongruity of being both investigator and culprit, perfectly capturing the frustration of hunting bugs you created yourself."
  rating: 10

- text: "How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'console.log' and the act of consoling someone, using wordplay that works on multiple technical and emotional levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours debugging. The problem was a missing semicolon. I'm not crying, you're crying."
  explanation: "This combines the setup-punchline with emotional escalation, highlighting the absurd frustration of trivial syntax errors causing massive time loss."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging is like being a doctor who has to cure a patient while the patient keeps insisting they feel fine."
  explanation: "Uses analogy to capture the frustration when programs appear to work but contain hidden bugs, creating humor through the absurd comparison."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code doesn't have bugs. It just develops random undocumented features."
  explanation: "The classic 'feature not a bug' defense, using misdirection and corporate-speak to reframe failures as successes, playing with superiority theory."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't bugs ever get lost? Because they always leave a stack trace."
  explanation: "A setup-punchline joke that plays on the double meaning of 'trace' - both following a path and the technical stack trace that helps locate errors."
  rating: 5

- text: "I finally fixed that bug! Now I have three new ones. It's like debugging whack-a-mole."
  explanation: "Uses the whack-a-mole metaphor to capture the cascading nature of bug fixes, with humor arising from the futile, endless nature of the task."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging tip: If it works, don't touch it. If you touch it, it won't work. If it doesn't work and you touch it, it still won't work but now you won't know why."
  explanation: "This escalating paradox uses the absurdity technique to create a recursive humor structure that mirrors the recursive nature of debugging problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "The code was working yesterday. Today it's not. I haven't changed anything. Narrator: He had changed everything."
  explanation: "Uses the unreliable narrator technique from storytelling, creating humor through the gap between perception and reality that every developer experiences."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite debugging technique? Rubber duck debugging. What's their second favorite? Blaming the compiler."
  explanation: "This two-part joke uses misdirection - starting with a legitimate technique then pivoting to the common defense mechanism of externalizing blame."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a program to help me debug. Now I have to debug the debugger. Send help."
  explanation: "Creates humor through recursive absurdity and meta-technical situations, capturing the infinite regress problem that sometimes occurs in development."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging at 2 AM: When you've been staring at the code so long, you start negotiating with it. 'Please work, and I'll refactor you tomorrow. I promise.'"
  explanation: "Personifies code while capturing the desperation and bargaining stage of late-night debugging, using relief theory to address common programmer stress."
  rating: 9

- text: "The bug wasn't in my code. It was in my understanding of reality."
  explanation: "This philosophical one-liner uses incongruity between technical and existential concepts, suggesting bugs are perception problems rather than code problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer quit debugging? He couldn't handle the emotional breakpoints anymore."
  explanation: "A sophisticated pun on 'breakpoints' (debugging tool) and 'breaking points' (emotional limits), layering technical and psychological meanings perfectly."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't have bugs in my code. I have spontaneous features waiting for the right product manager to discover them."
  explanation: "This uses corporate humor and misdirection to reframe bugs as opportunities, playing with the absurdity of spin culture in tech companies."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is the art of removing bugs. Programming is the art of inserting them in ways that make debugging interesting. I'm apparently a master artist."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses self-deprecating humor and paradox to reframe the entire development process, with the punchline elevating failure to artistry in an absurdist twist."
