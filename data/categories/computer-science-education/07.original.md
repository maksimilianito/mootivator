- text: "My CS professor said we'd learn to think like computers. Now I can't decide if I'm hungry without checking my internal state variables."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory by applying programming concepts (internal state variables) to basic human experiences (hunger). It's a gentle introduction that plays on the common experience of students adopting programming thinking patterns."

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to class? To reach higher-level programming languages."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke that uses the double meaning of 'higher-level' - both physical height and abstraction levels in programming languages. Classic setup-punchline structure."

- text: "Computer Science: where 'it works on my machine' is considered a valid defense."
  explanation: "This observational humor highlights a common frustration in CS education and professional practice, using the relief theory to acknowledge shared experiences with environment-dependent bugs."

- text: "My data structures professor is so organized, he sorts his children by height every morning."
  explanation: "Applies algorithmic thinking (sorting) to everyday life situations, creating humor through the absurdity of over-applying CS concepts to non-technical contexts."

- text: "Why don't CS students ever finish their homework on time? They're still optimizing their procrastination algorithm."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that combines the student experience of procrastination with technical terminology, creating a meta-joke about applying CS thinking to avoiding CS work."

- text: "Learned recursion today. To understand it, I first had to learn recursion."
  explanation: "A self-referential joke that demonstrates recursion by being recursive itself. It's meta-humor that works on multiple levels for different technical sophistication levels."

- text: "My algorithms class taught me that life is O(nÂ²) - it gets exponentially harder as you add more variables."
  explanation: "Uses Big O notation to comment on life complexity, though with a deliberate mathematical imprecision that adds to the humor through the mismatch between technical accuracy and emotional truth."

- text: "Why did the CS student fail their exam? They forgot to import knowledge."
  explanation: "Plays on the programming concept of importing libraries/modules, applying it to the learning process itself. Simple but effective wordplay."

- text: "Our professor said computer science isn't just about computers. Then spent 15 weeks teaching us about computers."
  explanation: "Highlights the ironic gap between CS education philosophy and practice, using misdirection to set up expectations that are then contradicted."

- text: "I asked my CS advisor about career prospects. He said, 'Your future is undefined.' I'm not sure if that's philosophical or a syntax error."
  explanation: "Double meaning joke using 'undefined' as both a philosophical concept and a programming error state, creating ambiguity that reflects student uncertainty."

- text: "Why do CS professors love teaching sorting algorithms? Because they can finally put their students in order."
  explanation: "Wordplay combining the technical concept of sorting with the classroom management desire for orderly students, using the superiority theory playfully."

- text: "My operating systems course taught me multitasking. Now I can fail at multiple assignments simultaneously."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that subverts the positive concept of multitasking, applying technical capability to academic struggle in an unexpected way."

- text: "Computer Science degree: four years to learn that Stack Overflow already knows everything you're about to be taught."
  explanation: "Commentary on modern CS education that acknowledges the reality of online resources, using incongruity between traditional education and self-directed learning."

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include a philosophy course? So students could ponder 'Why does this code work?' instead of just 'Does this code work?'"
  explanation: "Highlights the deeper questioning that comes with CS education, playing on the common experience of code working without understanding why."

- text: "Our database professor said relationships are important. Three years later, I understand foreign keys but still not people."
  explanation: "Uses the double meaning of 'relationships' (database relationships vs. human relationships) to create humor about the trade-offs of intensive technical education."

- text: "I told my CS professor I wanted to change the world. He said, 'Start by changing your variable names to something meaningful.'"
  explanation: "Deflates grandiose ambitions with practical advice, creating humor through the contrast between world-changing aspirations and mundane coding practices."

- text: "Why is CS education like garbage collection? You spend years learning it, then realize it mostly happens automatically and you just hope it works."
  explanation: "Meta-commentary on CS education using a technical concept (garbage collection) to question the value of deep theoretical knowledge versus practical automated solutions."

- text: "My compiler design course was so hard, even my code had an existential crisis and refused to compile."
  explanation: "Personifies code with human emotions, using absurdity to express the difficulty of advanced CS courses while maintaining the technical context of compilation."

- text: "Computer Science taught me that every problem can be solved with enough abstraction layers. Now I can't make simple decisions without creating a decision-making framework first."
  explanation: "Satirizes the CS tendency toward over-engineering and abstraction, showing how educational patterns can create comically impractical real-world behaviors."

- text: "Why do CS graduates make terrible comedians? They spend the whole setup explaining their joke's architecture, then the punchline throws an exception."
  explanation: "Self-aware meta-humor about CS communication style, using programming concepts (architecture, exceptions) to explain why technical humor itself can fail, making it funny by being the thing it describes."

- text: "My CS education can be summarized as: Year 1 - 'Computers are logical.' Year 2 - 'Computers are complex.' Year 3 - 'Computers are impossible.' Year 4 - 'Computers were a mistake.' Graduation - 'Senior Software Engineer position accepted.'"
  explanation: "A narrative progression joke that captures the entire emotional journey of CS education, from naive optimism through disillusionment to pragmatic acceptance, ending with the ironic punchline of still choosing the career despite everything."
