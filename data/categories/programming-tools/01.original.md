```yaml
- text: My IDE autocomplete suggested "break;" but I chose "continue;" instead. Story of my debugging life.
  explanation: This joke uses the double meaning of programming control flow statements (break/continue) and life decisions. The humor comes from the self-deprecating admission that the programmer ignores helpful suggestions and continues struggling, mirroring how these statements work in loops.

- text: Why did the developer switch to Vim? They wanted to quit, but couldn't figure out how.
  explanation: This plays on the infamous difficulty of exiting Vim editor (requiring the `:q` command), creating irony where someone switches TO something they immediately want to escape from. The misdirection is that "switch to" implies a positive choice, but the punchline reveals it became a trap.

- text: My text editor has a dark theme. My future has a darker one.
  explanation: This uses escalation humor, starting with the popular programming preference for dark mode and escalating to existential programmer dread. The parallel structure creates the comedic effect.

- text: Notepad++ is called "plus plus" because that's how many times you need to press Ctrl+Z after using Find and Replace.
  explanation: This joke reinterprets the "++" naming convention (from C++) as a reference to the increment operator, suggesting you need to undo many times. It plays on the common experience of Find and Replace operations going wrong.

- text: I told my IDE I needed space. It gave me 4 spaces. I wanted a tab. We're no longer compatible.
  explanation: This uses relationship metaphor humor applied to the infamous spaces vs tabs debate in programming. The incongruity comes from treating IDE preferences as relationship incompatibility, while also referencing the literal "space" formatting conflict.

- text: What's the difference between a junior developer and their IDE? The IDE actually knows when to suggest a breakpoint.
  explanation: This superiority theory joke compares a junior developer unfavorably to their tool, playing on the dual meaning of "breakpoint" (debugging tool and knowing when to take a break). The humor comes from the IDE being portrayed as more self-aware.

- text: My debugging strategy: add print statements until the IDE crashes. Then remove one print statement. Repeat.
  explanation: This absurdist joke exaggerates a common debugging technique (print debugging) to an illogical extreme where the solution creates a bigger problem. It highlights the sometimes backwards nature of debugging approaches.

- text: Why do developers love VS Code? Because it's the only thing in their life with a working extension.
  explanation: This uses double meaning humor where "extension" refers both to VS Code's plugin system and metaphorically to life extension/continuation. The self-deprecating tone suggests programmers' lives are otherwise falling apart.

- text: IntelliJ IDEA stands for "I Never Tell Everyone Logically Lazy Ideas Just Ideally Debug Everything Automatically."
  explanation: This creates a humorous backronym that actually describes the IDE's behavior - it does debug and suggest things automatically. The absurdity comes from forcing the acronym while accidentally describing the tool accurately.

- text: I switched from Sublime Text to VS Code. My computer's fan finally has a purpose in life.
  explanation: This joke uses exaggeration about VS Code's resource consumption (Electron-based) compared to Sublime's lightweight nature. The anthropomorphization of the computer fan adds to the humor - it was bored before and now works hard.

- text: What's an IDE's favorite exercise? Running. It does it constantly, whether you asked it to or not.
  explanation: This plays on the double meaning of "running" (physical exercise vs executing code) and references the frustration of IDEs automatically running or compiling code. The "whether you asked it to or not" adds the relatable complaint.

- text: My pair programming partner is my IDE's error checker. We argue constantly, but they're always right, and I hate them for it.
  explanation: This personifies the IDE's error detection as a relationship dynamic. The humor comes from the grudging admission that the annoying partner (error checker) is actually helpful, mirroring real pair programming tensions.

- text: Why did the developer break up with their IDE? It had too many commitment issues. Every save was a "git commit" suggestion.
  explanation: This uses relationship metaphor with version control integration. The wordplay on "commitment" (relationship commitment vs git commits) creates layers of meaning, while highlighting the sometimes pushy nature of IDE integrations.

- text: I configured my IDE to use Comic Sans for code. My pull requests are now rejected on sight. The system works.
  explanation: This absurdist joke uses the universally-mocked Comic Sans font as a deliberate bad choice. The deadpan "the system works" suggests this was an intentional social experiment in code review standards.

- text: What's the difference between a good IDE and a great IDE? A good IDE highlights your errors. A great IDE judges you silently while highlighting your errors.
  explanation: This escalation joke anthropomorphizes the IDE, suggesting that better tools come with emotional judgment. It plays on programmer insecurity and the feeling that even tools are disappointed in their code quality.

- text: My IDE has an AI assistant now. It suggested I take up gardening. I asked it to debug my code, and it suggested I plant a tree instead. Even AI knows when code is beyond saving.
  explanation: This multi-layered joke uses the modern trend of AI-assisted coding, but subverts expectations by having the AI give up on the code entirely. The progression from debugging request to career change suggestion creates escalating absurdity.

- text: Why do Emacs users have strong fingers? From holding down Ctrl+Meta+Alt+Shift while pressing X. Why do Vim users have strong legs? From walking to the kitchen while their colleague explains how to exit Vim.
  explanation: This comparative joke structure plays on the famous rivalry between Emacs and Vim, exaggerating Emacs's complex key combinations and Vim's confusing exit procedure. The parallel structure creates rhythm while roasting both editors equally.

- text: I spent three hours configuring my development environment. I spent three minutes writing code. I spent three days fixing what the environment broke. The circle of dev life.
  explanation: This uses the Rule of Three with escalating time scales to illustrate the absurd reality of development environment maintenance. The "circle of life" reference adds mock-epic tone to a frustrating reality.

- text: What did the Vim user say at their wedding? "I do :wq". What did the Emacs user say? "C-x M-c M-butterfly I do". What did the VS Code user say? "Installing marriage extension... 1 of 47 dependencies failed."
  explanation: This comparative joke uses each editor's characteristics - Vim's cryptic commands, Emacs's absurdly complex key combinations (including the joke xkcd butterfly command), and VS Code's dependency hell. The escalating absurdity across three editors creates compound humor.

- text: My IDE crashed and took my unsaved work with it. I pressed Ctrl+Z on my life choices. Nothing happened. Turns out, life doesn't have an undo buffer, but my IDE has a 1000-step history for code I already deleted. Priorities.
  explanation: This uses incongruity between what should be important (life) and what actually gets robust features (code history). The escalating frustration from IDE crash to existential crisis to bitter observation creates multiple humor layers while highlighting the irony of tool design priorities.

- text: A developer walks into a bar. The Vim user is still at the door trying to exit. The Emacs user has reconfigured the bar into a text editor. The VS Code user has installed 47 extensions and the bar is now serving TypeScript. The Notepad user ordered a drink. Everyone respects the Notepad user.
  explanation: This extended setup-punchline joke uses the classic "walks into a bar" format but subverts it by having each editor's stereotypical behavior play out. The punchline celebrates simplicity after escalating complexity, using the Rule of Three (plus one) structure and ending with an unexpected reversal that honors the humble choice.
