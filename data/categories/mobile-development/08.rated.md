- text: Why do mobile developers make terrible magicians? Because they can never make the loading spinner disappear fast enough.
  explanation: This compares magic tricks to UI performance, highlighting the universal frustration of slow loading times and the constant pressure to optimize mobile app performance.

- text: What's the difference between a mobile developer and a gardener? A gardener's plants grow naturally. A mobile developer's build.gradle file grows mysteriously overnight with dependencies they never added.
  explanation: This comparison joke highlights the frustrating reality of dependency management in mobile development, where configuration files seem to grow complex on their own, contrasting natural growth with chaotic technical growth.

- text: My mobile app is so cross-platform, it has an identity crisis. It thinks it's native on iOS, hybrid on Android, and a progressive web app on weekends.
  explanation: This personifies a mobile app with multiple personality disorder to satirize the confusion and complexity of modern cross-platform development strategies, where apps can be built using various approaches simultaneously.

- text: A product manager, a designer, and a mobile developer walk into a sprint planning meeting. The product manager says "I need it to work on all devices." The designer says "I need it to look pixel-perfect." The mobile developer says "I need a new career." Only the mobile developer leaves with realistic expectations.
  explanation: This extended joke uses the classic setup of three people with different perspectives, building tension through increasingly unrealistic demands before delivering a punchline that subverts expectations by having the developer choose escape over compromise, satirizing the impossible expectations placed on mobile developers.
