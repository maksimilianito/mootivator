- text: "I tried to commit my changes, but Git said I had conflicts. Story of my life."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'conflicts' - both the technical Git merge conflicts and personal life conflicts, creating a relatable moment of self-deprecating humor about life paralleling version control issues."

- text: "Why did the developer always use Git? Because SVN was too controlling."
  explanation: "This plays on the technical difference between distributed (Git) and centralized (SVN) version control systems, personifying SVN's centralized nature as being 'controlling' in a relationship sense."

- text: "My code works perfectly. I'm not committing it until I figure out why."
  explanation: "This reverses the expected behavior where developers commit working code, highlighting the paranoia and distrust programmers develop when something works unexpectedly well on the first try."

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite Git command? git blame. Finally, someone else to point fingers at!"
  explanation: "This exploits the dual meaning of 'git blame' - the actual command that shows who wrote each line of code, and the human tendency to deflect responsibility, creating humor through the superiority theory."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Just kidding, I use Git revert."
  explanation: "This misdirection joke sets up the expectation of bad practice (testing in production), then subverts it with the safety net of version control, while acknowledging the underlying truth that mistakes happen."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with SVN? Too much baggage in every checkout."
  explanation: "This uses the technical concept of SVN's full repository checkout as a metaphor for emotional baggage in relationships, creating a clever double meaning between technical and romantic contexts."

- text: "My Git repository is like my closet. I know there's something useful in there from 2015, but I'm afraid to look."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the relatable experience of old code and the anxiety of revisiting past work, using the everyday metaphor of a messy closet to describe technical debt."

- text: "What do you call a Git commit at 3 AM? A cry for help with a descriptive message."
  explanation: "This joke captures the reality of late-night coding sessions where commit messages become increasingly desperate or honest, playing on the relief theory of humor about workplace stress."

- text: "I told my team I'd branch out more. Now I have 47 unmerged feature branches."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'branch out' (both Git branches and personal growth) to create humor about the common problem of branch proliferation and poor Git hygiene."

- text: "Why don't version control systems go to therapy? They already know how to deal with their past."
  explanation: "This plays on the fundamental purpose of version control - managing history - and personifies it as emotional maturity, creating an absurd comparison between software and human psychology."

- text: "Git commit -m 'fixed stuff'. Narrator: He did not fix stuff."
  explanation: "This uses the popular narrator meme format to highlight the disconnect between vague commit messages and actual code changes, creating humor through the recognition of a common bad practice."

- text: "My relationship status? It's complicated. My Git history? Also complicated. At least I can rebase one of them."
  explanation: "This parallel structure compares romantic complications with Git history complications, with the punchline that only one is technically fixable through rebasing, highlighting programmer priorities."

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to use Git stash? He had commitment issues."
  explanation: "This creates a clever triple meaning with 'commitment' - Git commits, Git stash as temporary storage avoiding commits, and personal commitment issues, weaving technical and emotional contexts together."

- text: "I practice safe coding. I always pull before I push."
  explanation: "This uses innuendo-adjacent language while remaining work-appropriate, describing the proper Git workflow of pulling updates before pushing changes, creating humor through the suggestive phrasing of technical best practices."

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer's commit history? Seniors know how to rewrite history without getting caught."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the technical skill of using git rebase and commit amending while humorously comparing it to historical revisionism, highlighting experience levels through version control mastery."

- text: "My therapist asked about my childhood. I said 'git log --all' and we've been scrolling ever since."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke applies Git commands to personal therapy, with the humor coming from treating life history like code history, and the exaggeration of having too much history to process."

- text: "Why did the developer go to confession? To admit his force pushes to master."
  explanation: "This treats the cardinal sin of Git (force pushing to master/main branch) as a religious transgression requiring confession, elevating a technical mistake to moral failure for comedic effect."

- text: "I'm not saying I'm bad at Git, but my merge conflicts have merge conflicts."
  explanation: "This uses recursive absurdity to exaggerate incompetence with version control, creating an impossible scenario where even the conflicts themselves are conflicted, highlighting the complexity of merge resolution."

- text: "What did the Git repository say to the developer? 'You've got issues.' The developer replied, 'I know, I opened 47 of them.'"
  explanation: "This exploits the double meaning of 'issues' (personal problems vs. GitHub/GitLab issue tracking), with the developer's literal interpretation creating humor through the misdirection from emotional to technical context."

- text: "My code review came back with 'LGTM - Looks Good To Merge.' I'm framing it. It's my first one this year."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke plays on the rarity of approval in code reviews, treating a simple approval as a momentous achievement worthy of celebration, highlighting the often critical nature of peer review."

- text: "Why did the Git repository go to therapy? Because every time someone tried to merge, it had a breakdown. The therapist diagnosed it with 'detached HEAD syndrome' and recommended more frequent commits to maintain emotional stability."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor personifies a Git repository with psychological issues, using actual Git terminology (detached HEAD, merge, commits) as symptoms and treatments, creating layered humor that works both as technical satire and absurdist psychology, while the 'detached HEAD' reference adds a darkly comic element that experienced developers will appreciate."
