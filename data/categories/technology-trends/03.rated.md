- text: "I just upgraded to the latest framework. Now I need to upgrade my brain."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the rapid pace of technology change where learning new frameworks is constant. The incongruity comes from treating brain upgrades as casually as software upgrades, highlighting the mental exhaustion of keeping up with tech trends."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to learn the new JavaScript framework? It would be deprecated by the time he finished the tutorial."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to comment on the notoriously fast-paced JavaScript ecosystem where frameworks seem to become obsolete almost immediately. The setup establishes a learning scenario, and the punchline delivers the cynical reality many developers feel."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code is so cutting-edge, it's already legacy."
  explanation: "A paradoxical statement that compresses the entire lifecycle of technology into an impossibly short timeframe. The humor comes from the absurd contradiction and the shared experience of watching 'modern' tech become outdated rapidly."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally mastered React. My resume says 'experienced with legacy technologies.'"
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that plays on how quickly popular frameworks like React go from trendy to 'old.' The misdirection comes from expecting 'experienced' to be positive, but it's reframed as outdated knowledge."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the half-life of a tech stack? About six months, or one job interview."
  explanation: "Uses scientific terminology (half-life) applied to technology relevance. The dual timeframe joke suggests that tech becomes outdated either naturally over time or instantly when you mention it in interviews."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't have commitment issues. I'm just waiting for the next version."
  explanation: "Applies relationship terminology to technology adoption. The humor comes from reframing indecisiveness about technology choices as a personality trait, reflecting the anxiety of choosing tech that might soon be obsolete."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers always attend tech conferences? To learn what they should have learned last year."
  explanation: "Points out the paradox of technology education where by the time you learn something formally, it's already outdated. The setup implies professional development, but the punchline reveals futility."
  rating: 7

- text: "My startup's tech stack is so modern, the documentation doesn't exist yet."
  explanation: "Satirizes the bleeding-edge technology adoption where companies use tools so new they're barely usable. The absurdity highlights the tradeoff between being innovative and being practical."
  rating: 9

- text: "I'm not behind on technology trends. I'm just practicing retro development."
  explanation: "Reframes being outdated as a deliberate stylistic choice, similar to vintage fashion. The superiority theory applies here as the speaker defends their position with humorous justification."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's the difference between a stable API and a unicorn? Unicorns are mentioned in more documentation."
  explanation: "Compares two mythical things: stable APIs and unicorns. The misdirection suggests both are rare, but the punchline adds that at least unicorns get documented, highlighting API instability in modern development."
  rating: 8

- text: "I just migrated to the cloud. Now my technical debt is in the cloud too."
  explanation: "Plays on the double meaning of 'migration' where moving to cloud infrastructure doesn't solve fundamental code problems. The incongruity comes from treating technical debt as if it's physical baggage."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the AI researcher refuse to make predictions? Last year's breakthrough is this year's baseline."
  explanation: "Comments on the exponential pace of AI development where yesterday's achievements become today's minimum expectations. The humor reflects the futility of predicting in rapidly evolving fields."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our company adopted microservices. Now we have micro-problems in every service."
  explanation: "Wordplay on 'microservices' where the prefix 'micro-' is humorously applied to the resulting problems. This satirizes how architectural trends can multiply complexity rather than reduce it."
  rating: 9

- text: "I'm a full-stack developer. My stack is so full, it overflowed into next year's technologies."
  explanation: "Uses programming terminology (stack overflow) metaphorically to describe the overwhelming breadth of technologies developers are expected to know, including ones that don't exist yet."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a developer who uses the same framework for five years? A museum curator."
  explanation: "Exaggerates how quickly technology ages by comparing long-term framework users to museum workers. The superiority theory applies as it gently mocks both rapid change and those who resist it."
  rating: 7

- text: "My IoT devices are so smart, they're already planning their own obsolescence."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes smart devices with the awareness of their own planned obsolescence. The absurdity comes from giving devices consciousness about their inevitable replacement."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't learn new programming languages anymore. I just wait for them to compile to JavaScript."
  explanation: "Satirizes the trend of everything eventually compiling to JavaScript (TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc.). The joke suggests laziness but actually comments on JavaScript's ubiquity and the convergence of technologies."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the blockchain developer cross the road? To decentralize the other side."
  explanation: "Parodies the classic chicken joke while mocking how blockchain enthusiasts see decentralization as the solution to everything, even problems that don't exist. The absurdity is in applying blockchain to a simple action."
  rating: 7

- text: "Our quantum computer is so advanced, it's debugging code that hasn't been written yet."
  explanation: "Takes quantum computing's theoretical capabilities to an absurd extreme. The temporal paradox creates humor while commenting on the hype around emerging technologies that can seem almost magical."
  rating: 8

- text: "I'm not early to the metaverse. Everyone else is just late to reality."
  explanation: "Inverts the usual perspective on technology adoption, suggesting that physical reality is what people are behind on. This meta-humor comments on tech hype cycles and FOMO culture."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't developers trust technology trends? Because they've seen too many 'revolutions' that were just loops."
  explanation: "Uses programming terminology (loops) to describe how tech trends often cycle back to old ideas with new names. The cynical wisdom reflects experienced developers' skepticism about buzzwords and hype."
