- text: "My password is so secure, even I can't remember it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common security advice to create complex passwords, highlighting the ironic consequence that strong passwords become impossible to recall. The humor comes from the self-defeating nature of perfect security."

- text: "Why did the firewall go to therapy? It had too many trust issues."
  explanation: "This uses personification to apply the technical concept of firewalls blocking untrusted connections to human psychology. The double meaning of 'trust issues' works both technically and emotionally."

- text: "I encrypted my joke, but now nobody gets it."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that parallels encryption's purpose (making things unreadable) with the failure of a joke to land. The incongruity is that encryption succeeded too well, defeating communication."

- text: "Two-factor authentication: because one way to forget your login wasn't enough."
  explanation: "This employs the superiority theory through self-deprecating humor about forgetfulness, while highlighting the ironic tension between increased security and decreased convenience."

- text: "Why don't hackers ever get lost? They always find a backdoor."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay on 'backdoor' as both a physical entrance and a security vulnerability. The misdirection suggests navigation skills before revealing the security context."

- text: "My antivirus software detected a threat: my bank account balance."
  explanation: "This joke uses absurdist logic by treating a financial problem as a computer virus, creating humor through category confusion and relatable financial anxiety."

- text: "What's a hacker's favorite season? Phishing season."
  explanation: "A straightforward pun replacing 'fishing' with 'phishing,' the email scam technique. The setup-punchline structure is classic, with the humor in the homophone substitution."

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break. It suggested I try brute force."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'break' (rest vs. breaking into systems) and 'brute force' (physical strength vs. password cracking method), creating layered technical humor."

- text: "Why was the security expert always calm? He had everything under control-C."
  explanation: "A clever pun on the keyboard shortcut 'Control-C' (copy) reimagined as having things 'under control.' The technical reference adds depth to a common expression."

- text: "My encryption is so strong, I sent myself a message three years ago and I'm still trying to read it."
  explanation: "This absurdist exaggeration takes the concept of strong encryption to its illogical extreme, creating humor through temporal impossibility and self-inflicted confusion."

- text: "Why did the password go to school? To get more characters."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'characters' refers both to personality development and password complexity requirements. The misdirection leads audiences from education to security."

- text: "I asked my firewall for relationship advice. It said 'Block everyone and trust no one.' Seems extreme, but my data hasn't been compromised."
  explanation: "This extended joke anthropomorphizes security software, applying its logic to human relationships. The absurdity lies in treating antisocial behavior as successful strategy."

- text: "What do you call a security breach at a bakery? A cookie vulnerability."
  explanation: "A pun on browser cookies and actual cookies, playing with the technical term 'cookie vulnerability' in a food context. The incongruity creates accessible technical humor."

- text: "My password was 'incorrect' so whenever I forgot it, the computer would remind me: 'Your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This classic logic joke exploits the literal interpretation of error messages. The circular reasoning and meta-humor create multiple layers of comedy."

- text: "Why don't security experts trust stairs? They're always up to something. They prefer encrypted elevators."
  explanation: "This combines a classic setup with a technical twist. The initial pun on 'up to something' is subverted by adding the absurd concept of 'encrypted elevators.'"

- text: "A SQL injection walks into a bar, drops all the tables, and says 'Sorry, I thought this was a database.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke requires understanding of SQL injection attacks and the 'DROP TABLE' command. The personification and casual apology add absurdist humor to a serious security threat."

- text: "I use the same password everywhere: 'Incorrect.' That way when I forget it, my computer tells me 'Your password is Incorrect.'"
  explanation: "An extended version of the password meta-joke, this adds the element of intentional strategy to the absurdity, making the circular logic seem almost reasonable."

- text: "Why did the cybersecurity expert refuse to play cards? Too many potential exploits in the shuffle algorithm, and he didn't trust the dealer's random number generator."
  explanation: "This joke applies excessive security paranoia to a mundane activity, creating humor through the absurd over-application of technical concepts. The specific technical references (shuffle algorithm, RNG) add authenticity."

- text: "My password is the last 16 digits of pi. I'll tell you what it is as soon as I finish calculating it."
  explanation: "This mathematical humor plays on pi's infinite nature while pretending to use a finite portion. The impossibility of 'last 16 digits' creates the core absurdity, while suggesting a legitimately strong password strategy."

- text: "A hacker, a security expert, and a user walk into a bar. The hacker orders a beer. The security expert orders a beer and checks the bottle for tampering. The user orders a beer, clicks 'Accept All Cookies,' and wonders why his wallet is missing."
  explanation: "This tripartite joke contrasts three security mindsets, building from simple to paranoid to negligent. The escalation and the casual acceptance of tracking cookies paralleled with physical theft creates sharp social commentary."

- text: "I implemented military-grade encryption on my diary. Now the NSA and I are the only ones who can't read my teenage poetry. At least they have to suffer too."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke layers multiple concepts: the marketing term 'military-grade,' the irony of NSA surveillance, self-deprecating humor about teenage writing, and the absurd consolation that if you can't access your own data, at least you're sharing the pain. The resignation in the final line elevates it from simple irony to philosophical acceptance."
