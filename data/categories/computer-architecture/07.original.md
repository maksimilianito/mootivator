- text: "Cache coherence: when your CPU's left hand finally knows what its right hand is doing."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the idiom 'the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing' (meaning lack of coordination) and applies it to the technical challenge of cache coherence in multi-core processors, where different CPU cores must maintain consistent views of memory."

- text: "Why did the CPU go to therapy? It had too many pipeline hazards."
  explanation: "This uses the setup-punchline structure with a double meaning. 'Pipeline hazards' are real technical problems in CPU instruction pipelines, but 'hazards' also suggests psychological dangers or obstacles, making it sound like the CPU has emotional problems."

- text: "My processor supports speculative execution. Turns out, it's been speculating about retirement."
  explanation: "Speculative execution is a CPU optimization technique where instructions are executed before knowing if they're needed. The joke anthropomorphizes the CPU, suggesting it's 'speculating' about its future like a tired employee, creating incongruity between technical and human contexts."

- text: "Branch prediction is just astrology for CPUs."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory by comparing the sophisticated branch prediction algorithms in modern CPUs to pseudoscience (astrology), creating humor through the absurd comparison of a precise technical mechanism to something unscientific."

- text: "What's a CPU's favorite dance? The pipeline shuffle."
  explanation: "This plays on 'pipeline stalls' (a performance problem where the instruction pipeline gets disrupted) and turns it into a dance move called 'shuffle,' creating incongruity by applying entertainment concepts to technical problems."

- text: "I told my CPU a joke about memory hierarchy. It took forever to get it—had to fetch it from RAM."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses the concept of memory hierarchy (registers, cache, RAM, disk) where accessing RAM is slower than cache. The 'slowness' of getting the joke mirrors the latency of memory access, creating a self-referential humor about computer architecture itself."

- text: "Why don't processors trust each other in multicore systems? Too many race conditions."
  explanation: "Race conditions are bugs that occur when multiple cores access shared resources simultaneously. The joke anthropomorphizes CPUs as having trust issues, playing on both the technical problem and human relationship dynamics."

- text: "Out-of-order execution: because sometimes doing things wrong is faster than doing them right."
  explanation: "This aphorism creates humor through paradox. Out-of-order execution is actually a sophisticated optimization, but describing it as 'doing things wrong' makes it sound like a shortcut or hack, subverting expectations about what 'correct' means."

- text: "My CPU has 64 cores but still can't multitask my life."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke contrasts the impressive parallel processing capabilities of modern many-core processors with human inability to manage multiple life tasks, highlighting the superiority of computers in one domain while acknowledging human limitations in another."

- text: "What do you call a CPU that never makes mistakes? A liar—they all have errata documents."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the reality that all CPUs have documented bugs (errata) despite being precision-engineered. The punchline subverts the expectation of perfection, using the misdirection pattern to reveal an uncomfortable truth about hardware design."

- text: "Virtual memory is just gaslighting your programs about how much RAM they have."
  explanation: "This modern aphorism uses the psychological term 'gaslighting' to describe virtual memory's function of making programs believe they have more memory than physically exists. The anthropomorphization creates humor through the application of human manipulation tactics to technical systems."

- text: "Why did the architect choose RISC over CISC? He preferred his instructions like his coffee—simple and fast."
  explanation: "This joke references the RISC vs CISC debate in processor design (Reduced vs Complex Instruction Set Computing), using a relatable coffee preference metaphor to explain the philosophical difference between the two approaches."

- text: "A CPU walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we don't serve your kind here.' The CPU replies, 'That's fine, I'll just execute out of order.'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke uses the classic 'walks into a bar' setup but subverts it with a CPU-specific punchline about out-of-order execution, suggesting the CPU will ignore the bartender's sequential instruction."

- text: "Memory-mapped I/O: because sometimes pretending hardware is memory is easier than admitting you have trust issues with buses."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses psychological language ('trust issues') to describe the technical decision to map I/O devices into the memory address space rather than using separate I/O instructions, creating humor through anthropomorphization of architectural choices."

- text: "Why did the superscalar processor break up with its girlfriend? She said it was too committed to multiple relationships at once."
  explanation: "Superscalar processors execute multiple instructions simultaneously. The joke creates a double meaning where 'multiple relationships' refers both to handling multiple instruction streams and to romantic infidelity, using relationship humor to explain parallelism."

- text: "TLB miss: when your processor realizes it has no idea where anything is and has a small existential crisis."
  explanation: "The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) caches virtual-to-physical address translations. A TLB miss means the processor must do an expensive page table walk. Describing this as an 'existential crisis' anthropomorphizes the confusion and creates humor through exaggeration."

- text: "What's the difference between a CPU and a teenager? The CPU actually finishes what it starts—unless there's an interrupt."
  explanation: "This joke uses the superiority theory by comparing CPUs favorably to teenagers, then subverts it with the punchline about interrupts, which force CPUs to abandon their current task. The double reversal creates a more sophisticated humor structure."

- text: "Tomasulo's algorithm: proof that keeping track of who's waiting for what is complicated whether you're a CPU or planning a wedding."
  explanation: "Tomasulo's algorithm is a complex hardware technique for dynamic instruction scheduling. Comparing it to wedding planning creates incongruity by linking an abstract technical concept to a relatable, chaotic human experience."

- text: "Why do CPU designers love pipelining? Because five stages of denial are better than one."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke plays on 'five stages of grief' while referencing typical 5-stage CPU pipelines (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback). It suggests CPU design involves psychological denial about complexity, creating layered humor through the double meaning."

- text: "A hardware engineer, a software engineer, and a quantum physicist are discussing optimal architecture. The hardware engineer says, 'More cores!' The software engineer says, 'Better compilers!' The quantum physicist says, 'Why not both simultaneously until we measure performance?'"
  explanation: "This story-format joke builds on the classic 'three people walk into' structure but uses quantum superposition as the punchline, suggesting that like quantum states, architecture choices exist in superposition until measured—a meta-commentary on the difficulty of predicting performance."

- text: "Cache invalidation and naming things are the two hardest problems in computer science. Cache coherence protocols prove we solved the easier one."
  explanation: "This aphorism riffs on the famous Phil Karlton quote about hard problems in CS, but adds a twist suggesting that even our 'solution' (cache coherence protocols) is so complex that naming things must have been the easier problem—a paradoxical commentary on the difficulty of maintaining consistency in distributed systems."
