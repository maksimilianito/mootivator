- text: "My hard drive crashed. At least it was consistent with my dating life."
  explanation: "This joke uses self-deprecating humor and the superiority theory, drawing a parallel between hardware failure and personal relationship failures. The word 'crashed' works as a double meaning for both technical failure and romantic disaster."

- text: "Why did the RAM stick go to therapy? It had memory issues."
  explanation: "A simple setup-punchline structure exploiting the double meaning of 'memory issues' - both as a technical hardware problem and a psychological condition. The personification of hardware creates the incongruity."

- text: "My motherboard died. Guess I'm an orphan now."
  explanation: "This joke uses dark humor and wordplay on the term 'motherboard,' taking the familial metaphor literally. The unexpected emotional framing of a hardware failure creates the comedic incongruity."

- text: "The server went down more times than a toddler learning to walk."
  explanation: "This uses comparative humor and misdirection, comparing technical instability to a relatable human experience. The absurdity of the comparison creates the humor through incongruity theory."

- text: "Why don't dead pixels ever get invited to parties? They're always the ones who don't show up."
  explanation: "This personifies hardware defects and uses the double meaning of 'show up' - both appearing at social events and displaying on screen. The setup creates expectations that are fulfilled in an unexpected technical way."

- text: "My GPU overheated. Apparently 'hot' performance wasn't what I wanted."
  explanation: "Wordplay on 'hot' as both temperature and slang for impressive performance. The incongruity between marketing language and actual thermal failure creates the humor."

- text: "I told my failing hard drive a joke. It couldn't handle the sectors of humor."
  explanation: "This uses technical terminology ('sectors') as a pun for 'sections,' creating a meta-joke about hardware failure. The absurdity of telling jokes to hardware adds to the humor."

- text: "Why did the power supply break up with the motherboard? There was no connection anymore."
  explanation: "Relationship metaphor applied to hardware components, with 'connection' working both electrically and emotionally. The personification creates relatable humor from technical failure."

- text: "My computer's cooling fan died. Now it's just a heating fan with extra steps."
  explanation: "This uses absurdist logic and references the popular 'with extra steps' meme format. The ironic reversal of function creates the incongruity that drives the humor."

- text: "The RAID array failed. Turns out redundancy doesn't help when everything dies at once."
  explanation: "This joke requires technical knowledge of RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) and uses dark humor about the failure of a supposedly fail-safe system, creating irony through the defeat of the system's core purpose."

- text: "Why did the capacitor go to the doctor? It was having discharge problems."
  explanation: "Medical metaphor with technical accuracy about capacitor behavior. The double meaning of 'discharge' (both electrical and medical) creates layered humor."

- text: "My SSD failed silently. At least traditional hard drives had the courtesy to click ominously first."
  explanation: "This uses nostalgia humor and compares old versus new technology failure modes. The personification of hardware having 'courtesy' creates the absurd incongruity."

- text: "The network card crashed during my presentation. It really knew how to make an entrance by making an exit."
  explanation: "Paradoxical wordplay on 'entrance' and 'exit,' with the timing element adding to the relief theory aspect - the joke addresses the stress of public technical failures."

- text: "Why don't dead motherboards ever win arguments? They've lost all their logic circuits."
  explanation: "Double meaning of 'logic' - both the electronic circuits and rational thinking. The personification combined with technical accuracy creates sophisticated wordplay."

- text: "My CPU died at 100% load. It literally worked itself to death. I'm reporting this to OSHA."
  explanation: "This applies workplace safety regulations to computer components, creating absurdist humor through categorical confusion. The escalation to OSHA adds an unexpected bureaucratic layer."

- text: "The backup system failed. Turns out 'backup' was just a suggestion, not a guarantee."
  explanation: "Ironic humor about the failure of fail-safes. The casual dismissal of 'backup' as merely a suggestion undermines the entire concept of redundancy, creating dark technical humor."

- text: "Why did the graphics card go to art school? It wanted to learn how to render properly before it died."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'render' (artistic and computer graphics) and adds existential humor about hardware mortality. The personification and career aspirations create absurdist comedy."

- text: "My BIOS chip failed. Now my computer has an existential crisis every time it tries to boot - it literally doesn't know who it is."
  explanation: "Philosophical humor applied to the most fundamental hardware component. The BIOS's role in system identity creates a perfect metaphor for existential confusion, mixing deep technical knowledge with absurdist psychology."

- text: "The RAID controller died and took all six drives with it. It was less 'Redundant Array' and more 'Redundant Failure.' I should have called it RAIDF."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke requires understanding RAID acronyms and uses acronym modification for humor. The bitter irony of redundancy causing total failure creates dark comedy through complete subversion of expectations."

- text: "Why did the quantum computer's cooling system fail? Because it was simultaneously working and not working until someone checked on it, and unfortunately, they checked at the wrong time."
  explanation: "This is meta-humor referencing quantum superposition while describing a mundane cooling failure. The application of quantum mechanics to classical hardware failure creates sophisticated absurdist humor that works on multiple technical levels."

- text: "My server's redundant power supplies both failed during a thunderstorm. The manufacturer said it was a 'statistically improbable event.' I told them to update their statistics to include 'acts of God who hate my uptime.'"
  explanation: "This combines technical probability theory, religious metaphor, and the personal frustration of compound failures. The escalation from technical language to theological blame creates layered humor through incongruity, while the suggestion to update statistics with divine intervention is perfectly absurd."
