- text: "My code passes all tests, but I still added a comment: '// TODO: Figure out why this works.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common programmer experience of writing code that works correctly but whose logic isn't fully understood by the author. It inverts the typical TODO comment which usually marks broken or incomplete code, creating humor through the incongruity of successful code that mystifies its own creator."

- text: "Why did the developer name all their variables 'data'? They believed in minimalism."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes poor naming conventions by presenting terrible practice (using generic names like 'data' for everything) as if it were a deliberate design philosophy. The humor comes from the absurdity of confusing code obfuscation with minimalist aesthetics."

- text: "Clean code is like a joke—if you have to explain it, it's not that good."
  explanation: "This aphorism adapts the famous saying about jokes to code quality, drawing a parallel between self-evident humor and self-documenting code. It emphasizes that truly clean code should be immediately understandable without extensive comments or explanations."

- text: "I refactored my code for three hours. Now it does exactly the same thing, but I feel better about myself."
  explanation: "This joke captures the sometimes purely psychological benefits of refactoring. While the external behavior remains unchanged, the internal satisfaction of cleaner code structure provides emotional reward, highlighting the craftsmanship aspect of programming beyond mere functionality."

- text: "What's the difference between a junior and senior developer? The senior's technical debt has compound interest."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the financial metaphor of technical debt, suggesting that senior developers have accumulated more legacy code problems over their longer careers. It humorously inverts the expectation that experience means cleaner code, acknowledging that longevity often means more accumulated complexity."

- text: "My code review comments are 90% 'nit:' and 10% 'This will cause a production outage.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the imbalance in code review feedback between trivial style issues (nitpicks) and critical bugs. The humor comes from the disproportionate focus on minor details compared to catastrophic problems, reflecting a common frustration in code review culture."

- text: "Why don't programmers like to write documentation? Because good code is self-explanatory, and bad code is self-evident."
  explanation: "This joke presents a false dichotomy that programmers use to justify avoiding documentation. The humor lies in the flawed logic that documentation is unnecessary in both best and worst case scenarios, satirizing the common excuse for not documenting code."

- text: "I write code so clean, Marie Kondo wants to keep it."
  explanation: "This joke references Marie Kondo's famous tidying philosophy ('does it spark joy?') and applies it to code quality. The humor comes from treating code as a physical object that could be organized by a decluttering expert, elevating clean code to the status of joyful minimalism."

- text: "A programmer was found dead in the shower. Next to the shampoo bottle was a note: 'Lather, rinse, repeat.' He's still stuck in the loop."
  explanation: "This dark humor joke applies programming logic (infinite loops) to everyday instructions. The tragedy comes from taking algorithmic thinking too literally, showing how a programmer's mindset can create absurd real-world scenarios when loop termination conditions aren't specified."

- text: "How do you know a developer cares about code quality? They argue about tabs vs. spaces for 45 minutes instead of fixing the memory leak."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes misplaced priorities in software development, where developers often engage in passionate debates about trivial style issues while ignoring serious technical problems. It highlights the human tendency to focus on easily-debatable topics rather than complex challenges."

- text: "My manager asked me to add more comments to my code. So I added: '// This is a comment.'"
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates malicious compliance—technically fulfilling a request while completely missing its intent. The humor comes from the uselessness of the literal comment, satirizing both overly-specific management requests and developer resistance to documentation."

- text: "Why did the clean code advocate refuse to attend the meeting? Because it violated the Single Responsibility Principle—he was already responsible for writing code."
  explanation: "This joke applies the famous SOLID principle (Single Responsibility Principle) to human activities rather than code structure. The absurdity comes from treating design principles as life philosophies, humorously suggesting that clean code advocates take their principles to impractical extremes."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This joke parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format while describing the worst possible testing practice. The humor comes from presenting catastrophically bad methodology with the confidence usually reserved for best practices, satirizing cowboy coding culture."

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of music? Heavy metal—because it's the only thing harder than refactoring legacy code."
  explanation: "This joke uses musical genre as a metaphor for code difficulty, suggesting that even the 'heaviest' music is easier to handle than badly-written old code. The comparison creates humor through exaggeration while acknowledging the very real challenge of working with legacy systems."

- text: "My code has three states: doesn't work, works but I don't know why, and works until I try to explain it to someone."
  explanation: "This joke describes the frustrating progression of debugging and the 'rubber duck' phenomenon where explaining code to others reveals bugs. The humor comes from the universal experience of code that seems to break specifically when you're demonstrating it."

- text: "Why did the software architect bring a ladder to the code review? Someone said the abstraction layers were too high."
  explanation: "This joke creates a visual pun by taking the metaphor of 'abstraction layers' literally, imagining them as physical heights requiring a ladder. It satirizes over-engineering and excessive abstraction while playing with the spatial language often used in software architecture discussions."

- text: "I spent six hours making my code more readable. My coworker said, 'Now I can understand what doesn't work.'"
  explanation: "This joke subverts the expectation that readable code is inherently better by revealing that clarity simply made the bugs more obvious. The humor comes from the ironic outcome where improved code quality leads to discovering more problems rather than solving them."

- text: "How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None—that's a hardware problem. But they'll spend three days building a framework to automate it."
  explanation: "This joke captures programmer tendency to over-engineer solutions and avoid simple manual tasks in favor of complex automation. The humor lies in the disproportionate effort spent creating elaborate systems for trivial problems, a common pattern in software development."

- text: "My code is so DRY, it's causing droughts. My colleague's code is so WET, Noah's building an ark."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and WET (Write Everything Twice) principles by extending the metaphors to absurd extremes. The biblical reference adds another layer of humor while illustrating the importance of balance in code reusability."

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999 beers. Orders -1 beers. Orders a lizard. The bar burns down. A customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is—the bar explodes."
  explanation: "This joke perfectly captures the difference between testing edge cases and real-world usage. QA tests all the technical scenarios but misses the obvious human use case, illustrating how comprehensive testing still can't predict actual user behavior. The escalating absurdity mirrors how production issues always seem to find the one thing you didn't test."

- text: "I finally achieved 100% code coverage. Turns out, covering garbage with tests just gives you tested garbage with false confidence."
  explanation: "This joke challenges the cargo cult mentality around code coverage metrics, pointing out that high coverage percentages don't guarantee code quality. The humor comes from the realization that testing bad code thoroughly doesn't make it good code—it just makes it confidently bad, which is arguably worse."
