- text: "My IoT device has 2KB of RAM. That's not a limitation, that's a lifestyle choice."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the severe memory constraints of embedded systems, reframing a technical limitation as an intentional design philosophy, similar to minimalist lifestyle movements."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the microcontroller go to therapy? It had commitment issues with its watchdog timer."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'commitment issues' - both a psychological term and the technical reality that watchdog timers constantly reset systems that don't respond in time."
  rating: 8

- text: "Embedded developers don't have bugs. They have 'undocumented power-saving features.'"
  explanation: "This riffs on the classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' excuse, specifically tied to embedded systems where power consumption is critical and bugs often manifest as unexpected shutdowns."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my Arduino it could be anything. Now it identifies as a space heater."
  explanation: "This jokes about poorly optimized embedded code that causes excessive power consumption and heat generation, a common problem in resource-constrained systems."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't embedded programmers trust clouds? They prefer their data grounded in 256 bytes of EEPROM."
  explanation: "This contrasts the massive scale of cloud computing with the tiny storage of embedded systems, playing on both 'grounded' as practical and as electrically connected to ground."
  rating: 8

- text: "My smart toaster runs Linux. It takes 45 seconds to boot and 30 seconds to toast. Progress!"
  explanation: "This satirizes the trend of putting full operating systems on simple devices, where the OS overhead exceeds the actual useful work, defeating the purpose of 'smart' devices."
  rating: 9

- text: "How do you know someone develops for embedded systems? Don't worry, they'll tell you about their stack overflow in 128 bytes."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'how do you know someone is X' joke format while highlighting the absurdly small stack sizes in embedded systems that make stack overflow a constant concern."
  rating: 7

- text: "Real-time operating system: where 'eventually' is not in the vocabulary, but 'within 50 microseconds' is a promise."
  explanation: "This contrasts the vague timing of regular software with the hard real-time guarantees required in embedded systems, where timing isn't just important but legally binding."
  rating: 8

- text: "I optimized my firmware from 31KB to 30KB. My manager asked why I looked so proud. He'll never understand."
  explanation: "This captures the embedded developer's pride in tiny optimizations that seem meaningless to outsiders but represent significant achievements when working with 32KB flash memory limits."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the ESP32 break up with the Arduino? It said 'I need space' and meant it literally - 520KB of RAM."
  explanation: "This uses relationship breakup language to joke about the massive memory difference between older Arduino boards (2KB) and modern ESP32 chips (520KB), making the ESP32 seem spoiled."
  rating: 8

- text: "Debugging embedded systems: where printf is a luxury and blinking an LED is your only friend."
  explanation: "This highlights the severe debugging limitations in embedded systems where standard debugging tools don't exist, and developers resort to primitive methods like LED morse code."
  rating: 9

- text: "My IoT device is so secure, even I can't access it anymore. Mission accomplished?"
  explanation: "This satirizes IoT security implementations that are so restrictive they become unusable, playing on the incongruity between security success and practical failure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do embedded developers make terrible party guests? They spend all evening optimizing the refrigerator's duty cycle."
  explanation: "This jokes about the embedded developer's mindset of seeing every device as something to optimize, unable to turn off their professional instincts even at social events."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote an entire TCP/IP stack in 4KB. My therapist says I need to learn to ask for help."
  explanation: "This combines the absurd technical achievement of implementing networking in tiny memory with the psychological toll of such extreme optimization work, suggesting it's not mentally healthy."
  rating: 9

- text: "The three stages of embedded development: 'It doesn't work,' 'It works but I don't know why,' and 'It worked yesterday.'"
  explanation: "This parodies the three stages of life/career jokes while accurately capturing the mysterious and fragile nature of embedded systems where timing and hardware interactions create inexplicable behaviors."
  rating: 10

- text: "How many embedded developers does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They just bit-bang the GPIO pins until it looks like it's working."
  explanation: "This subverts the classic lightbulb joke format while referencing bit-banging, a technique where developers manually control pins instead of using proper hardware interfaces, often creating janky solutions."
  rating: 8

- text: "My microcontroller's idea of multitasking is switching between tasks so fast it looks like panic."
  explanation: "This jokes about cooperative multitasking in embedded systems where rapid task switching can resemble the frantic behavior of a panicked system, with the double meaning of 'panic' as both emotional state and system crash."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my smart doorbell what the meaning of life was. It said 'LOW_BATTERY' and went offline. Philosophically accurate."
  explanation: "This creates unexpected profundity from a common IoT frustration, suggesting that the doorbell's battery warning is actually a deep statement about mortality and finite resources, elevating a technical annoyance to existential commentary."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the embedded developer refuse to date? Every relationship had too much overhead for their 16MHz processor."
  explanation: "This applies embedded systems thinking to relationships, where the 'overhead' of emotional processing is too much for their limited 'processor,' creating a perfect metaphor for emotionally unavailable engineers."
  rating: 7

- text: "My firmware update bricked my toaster. Now it's just a regular brick that cost $200. At least it's IoT-enabled."
  explanation: "This satirizes the IoT industry's tendency to add connectivity to simple devices, where firmware updates can permanently break them, making an expensive smart toaster literally become an expensive dumb brick."
  rating: 8

- text: "Embedded systems: where you spend three weeks optimizing code to save 50 microseconds, then add a 100ms delay because 'it just works better that way.'"
  explanation: "This perfectly captures the absurd contradiction in embedded development where developers obsessively optimize for performance, then throw it all away with arbitrary delays to fix timing issues they don't fully understand, highlighting the gap between theory and practice."
