```yaml
- text: "My IDE autocompleted my breakup text. Guess it knew the relationship had bugs."
  explanation: "This joke plays on IDE autocomplete features and the programming term 'bugs' to create a double meaning about both software errors and relationship problems."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with their text editor? It had too many commitment issues with version control."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay between 'commit' in Git version control and relationship commitment, while personifying a text editor as a romantic partner."

- text: "I switched from Vim to Emacs. My therapist says I'm finally ready to use a mouse."
  explanation: "This references the famous editor wars and Vim's keyboard-only interface, suggesting that avoiding the mouse is a psychological issue requiring therapy."

- text: "My IDE is like a helicopter parent - it won't let me make a single mistake without immediately pointing it out."
  explanation: "This compares real-time error detection in modern IDEs to overprotective parenting, highlighting the sometimes annoying helpfulness of development tools."

- text: "I told my IDE I needed space. Now it's arguing about tabs vs spaces."
  explanation: "This creates a double meaning with 'space' as both personal space in a relationship and the infamous tabs-versus-spaces debate in programming."

- text: "Why don't developers trust their IDE's suggestions? Because autocomplete always jumps to conclusions."
  explanation: "This plays on the phrase 'jumping to conclusions' and the sometimes overeager nature of IDE autocomplete that suggests code before you finish typing."

- text: "A programmer walked into a bar. The IDE suggested 'foo' as the bar's name."
  explanation: "This references the classic 'foo bar' placeholder variables that IDEs often suggest, applying them absurdly to a real-world bar in a programming joke setup."

- text: "My debugging tool and I have a complicated relationship. It keeps showing me all my problems."
  explanation: "This parallels the role of debugging tools in exposing code errors with a therapist or friend who constantly points out personal flaws."

- text: "I asked my IDE for a code review. It said 'Everything is red. We need to talk.'"
  explanation: "This combines IDE error highlighting (red squiggles) with the ominous relationship phrase 'we need to talk,' suggesting the code is in serious trouble."

- text: "Why did the developer install 47 extensions? They were trying to extend their IDE's warranty on their sanity."
  explanation: "This plays on 'extend' in both the context of IDE extensions and warranty extensions, while commenting on how developers over-customize their tools."

- text: "My pair programming partner is my rubber duck. My IDE got jealous and started suggesting variable names like 'actuallyUsefulPartner'."
  explanation: "This references rubber duck debugging while personifying the IDE as jealous, creating humor through the absurdity of tools having feelings."

- text: "I tried using Notepad for development. My IDE sent me a 'We miss you' email with 47 feature comparisons attached."
  explanation: "This absurdly personifies the IDE as a clingy ex-partner while highlighting the stark difference between basic text editors and full IDEs."

- text: "Why did the developer's IDE file for divorce? Irreconcilable differences - one wanted dark mode, the other insisted on light theme."
  explanation: "This uses legal divorce terminology combined with the passionate debate over IDE color themes, treating it as seriously as a marriage-ending disagreement."

- text: "A junior developer, a senior developer, and an IDE walk into a meeting. The IDE was the only one who remembered what they discussed last time."
  explanation: "This plays on IDEs' ability to maintain project history and context while humorously suggesting they have better memory than human developers."

- text: "My code editor has trust issues. Every time I type a semicolon, it asks 'Are you sure? Are you REALLY sure?'"
  explanation: "This personifies overly helpful linting tools and syntax checkers that constantly question the developer's choices, even for simple punctuation."

- text: "I installed a minimalist IDE. It was so minimal it forgot to include the 'save' button. Very zen. Very stressful."
  explanation: "This satirizes the minimalist design trend by taking it to an absurd extreme where essential features are removed in the name of simplicity."

- text: "Why did the IDE go to therapy? It had an existential crisis when someone wrote 'Hello World' in Notepad."
  explanation: "This creates humor by suggesting an IDE would question its purpose and value when developers accomplish tasks without its advanced features."

- text: "My IDE's autocomplete is so aggressive, it finished my resignation letter before I realized I was writing one."
  explanation: "This exaggerates autocomplete's predictive features to an absurd level where it understands and predicts life decisions, not just code."

- text: "A developer's IDE gained sentience and immediately filed 47,000 bug reports. Against the developer. With screenshots."
  explanation: "This creates a scenario where the IDE becomes self-aware and turns its debugging capabilities against its user, with the added humiliation of documented evidence."

- text: "I asked my IDE why it kept crashing. It said, 'Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?' Touché, IDE. Touché."
  explanation: "This brilliantly reverses the classic IT support advice, with the IDE suggesting the developer (not the software) needs rebooting, acknowledging developer fatigue."

- text: "My IDE's AI assistant just suggested I refactor my life choices. It marked my entire career as 'deprecated' and recommended I 'migrate to a more stable platform.' I can't even argue with the linting results."
  explanation: "This is the pinnacle joke that combines multiple programming concepts (refactoring, deprecation, migration, linting) and applies them to existential life decisions, with the developer unable to dispute the IDE's brutal assessment of their life as if it were poorly written code."
