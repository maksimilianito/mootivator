- text: "Mobile developers don't have bugs, they have 'device-specific features'."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common excuse developers use when their app works on one device but fails on another, reframing bugs as intentional features to avoid accountability."

- text: "Why did the mobile app go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'dependencies' - both the technical term for external libraries an app needs and the psychological term for emotional reliance issues."

- text: "iOS developer's favorite exercise? Swift lifts."
  explanation: "A simple pun combining Swift (Apple's programming language) with weight lifting, suggesting mobile developers need physical strength to handle their work."

- text: "Android fragmentation: where testing on 5 devices means you've covered 2% of your users."
  explanation: "This highlights the notorious problem of Android's ecosystem having thousands of different device configurations, making comprehensive testing nearly impossible."

- text: "Why do mobile developers always carry a charger? Because their apps drain batteries faster than they can say 'optimization'."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke about poorly optimized mobile apps that consume excessive battery power, a common user complaint."

- text: "Mobile development: where 'it works on my device' is both a debugging strategy and a retirement plan."
  explanation: "This mocks the inadequate testing practice of only checking apps on the developer's own device, suggesting this approach will haunt them forever."

- text: "What's a mobile developer's favorite type of relationship? One with good compatibility and no fragmentation issues."
  explanation: "This applies mobile development terminology (compatibility, fragmentation) to romantic relationships, suggesting developers view everything through their technical lens."

- text: "I asked my mobile app for directions. It requested access to my contacts, photos, and microphone first."
  explanation: "This satirizes the excessive permission requests many mobile apps make, even when those permissions have nothing to do with the app's core functionality."

- text: "Why did the mobile developer break up with their partner? They couldn't handle the constant push notifications."
  explanation: "A play on 'push notifications' (a mobile app feature) applied to an annoying, demanding partner who constantly needs attention."

- text: "Mobile app store reviews: where one-star ratings come with feature requests and five-star ratings come with no comments."
  explanation: "This observes the paradox that users who hate an app write detailed feedback, while satisfied users just rate without explaining why."

- text: "Cross-platform development: write once, debug everywhere, cry always."
  explanation: "A twist on the promise of cross-platform frameworks ('write once, run anywhere'), acknowledging that the reality involves platform-specific bugs and emotional distress."

- text: "Why don't mobile developers trust the cloud? Because they've seen what happens when you have no connection."
  explanation: "This references the dependency on internet connectivity for cloud services and how mobile apps often fail ungracefully when offline."

- text: "A mobile developer walks into a bar. The bar crashes. The developer says, 'Must be a memory leak.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'bar' (drinking establishment and UI element) and 'crashes' (physical collapse and app failure) while referencing memory leaks, a common mobile development issue."

- text: "What's the difference between a mobile app and a teenager? The teenager eventually stops asking for permissions."
  explanation: "This compares the constant permission requests from mobile apps to teenagers asking their parents for things, with the humorous twist that apps never mature out of this behavior."

- text: "Mobile developer's prayer: 'Dear Lord, please let this work on the first try. Amen. It didn't work. Amen again.'"
  explanation: "This captures the hopeful optimism followed by immediate disappointment that characterizes the mobile development experience, especially when dealing with builds and deployments."

- text: "Why did the React Native developer refuse to take sides? They were committed to staying cross-platform, even in arguments."
  explanation: "This plays on React Native's cross-platform nature, applying it to personal conflict resolution and suggesting developers can't choose between iOS and Android even in daily life."

- text: "App update notes: 'Bug fixes and performance improvements.' Translation: 'We fixed the bug we introduced in the last update and made the app 200MB larger.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes the vague, generic update descriptions apps provide while highlighting the reality that updates often fix problems they created and bloat the app size."

- text: "A mobile developer's most used Git commit message: 'Fixed layout on Galaxy S7 running Android 8.1 in landscape mode with large font enabled.'"
  explanation: "This exaggerates the specificity required when fixing Android fragmentation issues, showing how a single bug fix might only apply to an incredibly narrow set of conditions."

- text: "Why did the mobile app fail its driving test? It kept requesting location permissions but still couldn't find its way."
  explanation: "This mocks apps that demand location access but still provide poor navigation or location-based features, personifying the app as incompetent despite having all the data it needs."

- text: "Mobile development is the only field where 'supporting the last two versions' means dealing with technology from 47 different centuries."
  explanation: "This humorously exaggerates how quickly mobile technology evolves, making even recent versions feel ancient, and how 'two versions' can span vastly different technological capabilities."

- text: "A product manager, designer, and mobile developer walk into a meeting. The PM says, 'Make it like Instagram.' The designer says, 'But simpler.' The developer opens LinkedIn and updates their resume."
  explanation: "This perfectly captures the frustration of impossible requirements - wanting Instagram's complexity with simplicity, while the developer recognizes this as their cue to find a new job rather than attempt the impossible."
