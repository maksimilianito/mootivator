- text: "My code is clean. The comments said so in 2019."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that outdated comments don't reflect current code quality, highlighting how documentation becomes stale while developers convince themselves their code remains clean."

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to comment his code? He said it was 'self-documenting' — just like his last three jobs."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection to mock the 'self-documenting code' excuse while suggesting the developer's employment history speaks for itself, implying poor code quality leads to job changes."

- text: "I don't always write clean code, but when I do, it's because someone's watching my screen share."
  explanation: "This parodies the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format while exposing the truth that developers often only write quality code when accountability is immediate and visible."

- text: "What's the difference between legacy code and vintage wine? Nobody pretends the code gets better with age."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity theory by comparing two things that age, but inverting the expectation — wine improves, but everyone knows old code just becomes more problematic."

- text: "Technical debt: because 'I'll fix it later' is a developer's version of a subprime mortgage."
  explanation: "This creates humor by comparing programming procrastination to the financial crisis, suggesting that deferred code quality issues lead to systemic collapse, just like bad mortgages."

- text: "Why don't code reviewers ever win at poker? They can't help but point out every bad hand."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay with 'hand' (poker cards and code quality) while highlighting the personality trait of reviewers who compulsively critique everything they see."

- text: "My code passed all the tests. Unfortunately, I wrote the tests."
  explanation: "This reveals the circular logic problem in software quality — when the same person writes both code and tests, confirmation bias ensures everything 'works' despite potential issues."

- text: "Clean code is like a clean desk: a sign that someone just moved all the problems into a drawer called 'utils'."
  explanation: "This exposes the common practice of hiding messy code in utility folders rather than actually improving it, creating only the appearance of organization."

- text: "What do you call a developer who writes maintainable code? Unemployed — they finish projects too quickly."
  explanation: "This uses dark humor and the superiority theory to suggest that job security comes from creating unmaintainable code that requires constant attention, inverting the expected value of quality."

- text: "I refactored my code into three functions: doTheThing(), doTheOtherThing(), and handleTheWeirdCaseFromProduction()."
  explanation: "This mocks poor naming conventions and the reality that production always reveals edge cases, showing how 'clean' refactoring often just rearranges the mess."

- text: "Why did the software architect bring a broom to the code review? Someone told him to clean up the abstractions, and he took it literally."
  explanation: "This uses absurdity and literal interpretation of 'cleaning' code to highlight how abstract the concept of code quality really is — you can't physically clean it."

- text: "My manager asked for 'enterprise-grade code quality.' So I added three layers of abstraction and a factory pattern. Now nobody knows what it does, including me."
  explanation: "This satirizes over-engineering and the tendency to equate complexity with quality, showing how 'enterprise' often means unnecessarily complicated rather than actually better."

- text: "How many developers does it take to maintain clean code? None — they all left for companies that don't care."
  explanation: "This uses cynical humor to comment on the reality that maintaining code quality is often undervalued in the industry, leading to brain drain from quality-focused organizations."

- text: "I wrote a function so clean, even my code reviewer cried. Turns out they were tears of suspicion."
  explanation: "This subverts the expectation that tears would be from joy, suggesting that unusually clean code is so rare it triggers distrust rather than appreciation."

- text: "What's a developer's favorite fairy tale? 'The Boy Who Cried Technical Debt' — except in this version, the wolf actually comes, and it eats the entire codebase."
  explanation: "This reimagines a classic fable to show that unlike the fairy tale, technical debt warnings are real and ignoring them leads to actual disaster, not just false alarms."

- text: "My code review feedback: 'This is beautiful.' My immediate thought: 'What did I break?'"
  explanation: "This reveals the imposter syndrome and paranoia developers develop from experience — positive feedback triggers anxiety because code is rarely actually perfect on first try."

- text: "Why did the junior developer cry after reading 'Clean Code'? They realized they'd been writing dirty code their whole career — all three months of it."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration and timing misdirection to mock both the junior developer's limited experience and the tendency to have existential crises over programming books."

- text: "I asked my senior developer what 'maintainable code' means. He opened a file from 2015, read for five minutes, then quietly closed his laptop and went home for the day."
  explanation: "This uses narrative humor and actions-speak-louder-than-words to show that the true definition of maintainability is whether you can face your old code without emotional trauma."

- text: "Code quality is like quantum mechanics: it exists in a superposition of 'works perfectly' and 'complete disaster' until someone actually tries to modify it."
  explanation: "This applies quantum physics concepts to programming, suggesting that code quality is uncertain until observed (modified), at which point it collapses into one state — usually disaster."

- text: "My code is so clean, Marie Kondo tried to use it as an example. Then she opened the node_modules folder and had to lie down."
  explanation: "This references the tidying expert Marie Kondo and creates humor through the contrast between organized code and the chaotic reality of dependencies, suggesting even organization experts can't handle modern development."

- text: "A developer dies and meets St. Peter at the gates. 'Before entering,' says Peter, 'you must explain one function from your codebase.' The developer looks at his old code, then turns around and walks straight to hell. 'At least there,' he says, 'nobody will ask me what I meant by handleStuffAndThings().'"
  explanation: "This extended narrative joke uses the setup of divine judgment to explore the ultimate consequence of poor code quality — that explaining your own bad code is literally worse than eternal damnation, and that death itself doesn't excuse you from code reviews."
