- text: "TCP: 'I want to tell you a joke.' IP: 'OK.' TCP: 'OK, I'll tell you a joke.'"
  explanation: This joke plays on TCP's three-way handshake protocol (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) where TCP establishes a connection before transmitting data, showing how overly formal the protocol is even for simple communication.
  rating: 9

- text: "UDP walks into a bar. The bartender doesn't acknowledge him."
  explanation: UDP is a connectionless protocol that doesn't require acknowledgment of received packets, unlike TCP. The joke personifies this technical characteristic into a social situation.
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did HTTP go to therapy? It had too many issues with commitment."
  explanation: HTTP is a stateless protocol that doesn't maintain persistent connections by default, treating each request independently. This is contrasted humorously with relationship commitment issues.

- text: "An IPv4 address walks into a bar and says, 'I'm running out of space.' IPv6 replies, 'I have room for 340 undecillion friends.'"
  explanation: This references the address exhaustion problem of IPv4's limited address space versus IPv6's astronomically larger address space, personifying the protocols as bar patrons discussing their social capacity.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't DNS servers ever win arguments? Because they always have to ask someone else for the answer."
  explanation: DNS servers work hierarchically, querying other servers to resolve domain names. The joke compares this technical dependency to someone who can't answer questions independently.

- text: "FTP tried to secure a date, but SFTP already encrypted the conversation."
  explanation: This plays on the security differences between FTP (insecure) and SFTP (secure), using dating terminology where 'secure' and 'encrypted' take on double meanings about relationships and data protection.

- text: "Why was the network engineer always calm? Because he knew how to handle his packets."
  explanation: The joke uses 'packets' as both network data units and a play on 'keeping your composure' or 'handling situations,' creating a double meaning about professional competence.
  rating: 5

- text: "A packet walks into a router. The router says, 'Sorry, I don't know where you're going.' The packet replies, 'That's okay, I have a header for that.'"
  explanation: Packet headers contain routing information that tells routers where to forward the packet. The joke personifies this technical relationship as a conversation about getting directions.
  rating: 7

- text: "ICMP walks into a bar and shouts, 'Is anyone alive in here?' Everyone replies, 'Yes!' That's basically a ping."
  explanation: ICMP's ping function sends echo requests to check if hosts are reachable and receives echo replies. The joke translates this technical handshake into a humorous bar scenario.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the TCP packet go to anger management? It kept retransmitting its complaints."
  explanation: TCP's reliability mechanism involves retransmitting lost packets. The joke compares this persistence to someone who won't stop repeating their grievances, a common frustration in relationships.
  rating: 8

- text: "HTTP and HTTPS walk into a bar. The bartender serves HTTPS first. HTTP asks why, and the bartender says, 'He's got better credentials.'"
  explanation: HTTPS uses SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication, giving it 'credentials' that HTTP lacks. The joke plays on both technical authentication and social credibility.
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't routers ever gossip? Because they only forward what they're told, never the whole story."
  explanation: Routers forward packets based on headers without examining the entire payload, similar to someone who passes along information without understanding the full context.
  rating: 6

- text: "A network administrator's favorite dance? The TCP shuffle: step, step, acknowledge. Step, step, acknowledge."
  explanation: This personifies TCP's acknowledgment mechanism as a repetitive dance, highlighting how TCP confirms receipt of every segment in a rhythmic, predictable pattern.
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the REST API break up with SOAP? It said, 'You're too complicated. I need someone more stateless.'"
  explanation: REST is simpler and stateless compared to SOAP's complex, stateful nature. The joke frames this architectural difference as incompatible personality traits in a relationship.
  rating: 8

- text: "A SYN packet walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'I'll SYN-ACK to that!' The packet replies, 'ACK!' Now they're connected for life."
  explanation: This elaborates on TCP's three-way handshake as a romantic connection ritual, where the technical protocol becomes a marriage ceremony, playing on 'connected' having both technical and emotional meanings.
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do network protocols make terrible comedians? Because UDP doesn't care if you got the joke, and TCP keeps repeating the punchline until you laugh."
  explanation: This contrasts UDP's unreliable, fire-and-forget approach with TCP's reliable, persistent retransmission, comparing them to different comedy stylesâ€”one careless, one annoyingly persistent.
  rating: 10

- text: "An Ethernet frame walks into a bar wearing a fancy outfit. The bartender says, 'Nice headers!' The frame replies, 'Thanks, but wait till you see my trailer!'"
  explanation: Ethernet frames have both headers and trailers (footers) containing control information. The joke uses fashion terminology where 'headers' and 'trailers' become clothing accessories.
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the network engineer refuse to use UDP for important messages? Because 'I love you' is not something you want to transmit unreliably."
  explanation: This joke highlights UDP's unreliable nature by applying it to emotional communication where message delivery is critical, creating humor through the absurdity of losing such important data.

- text: "A NAT router walks into a bar with 254 friends. The bartender says, 'Sorry, I only see one of you.' The router smiles and says, 'That's the point.'"
  explanation: Network Address Translation allows multiple devices to share one public IP address. The joke personifies this as a router successfully hiding its friends, making the technical masquerading concept socially humorous.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the BGP session take so long to make friends? Because it needed to exchange complete routing tables before trusting anyone, and even then, it periodically checked if they were still reliable."
  explanation: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) exchanges full routing information and uses keepalive messages to maintain sessions. The joke compares this extensive verification process to someone with severe trust issues in relationships.

- text: "A network packet dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter checks the TTL and says, 'Sorry, you've expired.' The packet protests, 'But I was only 64 hops away from my destination!' St. Peter replies, 'Should've started with 255 like everyone else. Next time, plan your route better.'"
  explanation: TTL (Time To Live) prevents packets from circulating forever by decrementing at each hop. This joke creates an afterlife scenario where the technical concept of packet expiration becomes literal death, with St. Peter as the ultimate router making forwarding decisions based on protocol specifications.
