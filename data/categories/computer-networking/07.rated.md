- text: "My router keeps dropping packets. I told it to use both hands."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity of treating network packet loss as a physical dropping problem, applying a literal solution to a technical issue."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the network administrator bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud."
  explanation: "Simple wordplay on 'cloud computing' being treated as a physical location, creating humor through the literal interpretation of technical terminology."
  rating: 5

- text: "I tried to ping my friend, but he didn't respond. Turns out he had his firewall up."
  explanation: "Uses network terminology (ping, firewall) as metaphors for human communication, creating humor through the application of technical concepts to social situations."
  rating: 7

- text: "The OSI model has 7 layers. My network problems have 70."
  explanation: "Plays on the famous 7-layer OSI model while exaggerating the complexity of real-world networking issues, using numerical escalation for comedic effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't network engineers ever get lost? They always follow the routing table."
  explanation: "Applies networking concepts to everyday navigation, creating humor through the incongruity of using technical solutions for common problems."
  rating: 5

- text: "My network topology is so complex, even I need a map to find the coffee machine."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that exaggerates network complexity while comparing it to simple physical navigation, highlighting the absurdity of over-complicated systems."
  rating: 6

- text: "TCP and UDP walked into a bar. The bartender said 'I'll get you a drink.' TCP said 'Did you get my order?' UDP said 'Whatever' and left."
  explanation: "Personifies the two main transport protocols, with TCP's reliability and acknowledgment contrasting with UDP's connectionless, fire-and-forget nature."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the subnet mask go to therapy? It had too many identity issues with its bits."
  explanation: "Uses psychological concepts applied to subnet masks, which literally determine network identity through bit manipulation, creating layered technical humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "I named my Wi-Fi 'Hidden Network' so my neighbors think they're hackers when they find it."
  explanation: "Plays on the irony of making something seem hidden while actually making it more obvious, exploiting common misunderstandings about network security."
  rating: 8

- text: "A network packet walks into a bar. The bartender says 'We don't serve your type here.' The packet fragments and leaves through multiple exits."
  explanation: "Sophisticated joke about packet fragmentation, where large packets are split into smaller pieces, personified as a social rejection scenario."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do network cables make terrible comedians? Their timing is always off by a few milliseconds."
  explanation: "References network latency and timing issues while applying them to comedic timing, creating a meta-joke about humor delivery."
  rating: 7

- text: "My network switch has 48 ports but still can't make a single good decision."
  explanation: "Plays on the double meaning of 'port' (network connection) and the expectation that more options should lead to better decisions, applying human psychology to network hardware."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my network it was experiencing congestion. It replied with a SYN-ACK and continued flooding anyway."
  explanation: "Technical joke about TCP handshakes and network flooding, where the network 'acknowledges' the problem but doesn't actually fix it, mimicking frustrating human behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the network administrator refuse to play cards? He was tired of dealing with broadcast storms."
  explanation: "Combines the card-playing term 'dealing' with the networking problem of broadcast storms, where excessive network traffic overwhelms the system."
  rating: 6

- text: "A router, a switch, and a hub walked into a bar. The hub told everyone everything it heard. The switch whispered to the right person. The router checked if they were even in the right bar."
  explanation: "Perfectly characterizes the three devices: hubs broadcast to all, switches send to specific ports, and routers determine network paths, personified in a social setting."
  rating: 9

- text: "My network has three states: working, not working, and 'working' in air quotes when the CEO is watching."
  explanation: "Satirizes workplace politics where networks appear functional under scrutiny but have underlying issues, combining technical reality with social dynamics."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't network engineers trust the ARP protocol? Because it keeps lying about who it is."
  explanation: "References ARP spoofing attacks where malicious actors impersonate other devices, applying concepts of trust and deception to network protocols."
  rating: 7

- text: "I implemented a mesh network topology at home. Now my devices won't stop gossiping about each other's bandwidth usage."
  explanation: "Mesh networks where devices communicate with multiple neighbors are personified as gossiping, creating humor through the social interpretation of network communication patterns."
  rating: 8

- text: "A network engineer died and went to heaven. St. Peter said 'Your eternal IP is 127.0.0.1.' The engineer replied 'So I'm going to spend eternity talking to myself?' St. Peter smiled and said 'Welcome to localhost paradise.'"
  explanation: "Sophisticated joke about the loopback address (localhost/127.0.0.1) which always points to the device itself, creating an existential metaphor about self-reflection and isolation."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the BGP router break up with OSPF? Because BGP said 'I need spaceâ€”like, autonomous system space. You're too clingy with your link-state updates every time something changes.'"
  explanation: "Advanced networking humor comparing routing protocols to relationship dynamics: BGP operates between autonomous systems (distant), while OSPF constantly updates within networks (clingy), perfectly capturing their technical differences through romantic metaphor."
  rating: 9

- text: "A network packet's journey is like my life: started with high hopes and a clear destination, got fragmented along the way, half of me arrived late, the other half never made it, and somehow I still got reassembled into something that technically works but nobody's quite sure how."
  explanation: "Existential humor that parallels the technical process of packet fragmentation and reassembly with life's challenges, creating deep resonance through the metaphor of maintaining identity despite being broken apart and imperfectly reconstructed."
