- text: "I named my Wi-Fi 'Hide and Seek' but everyone keeps finding it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the contradiction between the network name suggesting concealment and the fundamental purpose of Wi-Fi, which is to broadcast its presence so devices can connect. The incongruity creates humor through the futile attempt to hide something designed to be discovered."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the router go to therapy? It had too many connection issues."
  explanation: "This uses double meaning - 'connection issues' refers both to technical network connectivity problems and emotional relationship difficulties. The anthropomorphization of the router creates a simple setup-punchline structure that bridges technical and human experiences."
  rating: 7

- text: "My network topology is a tree. It has lots of branches but no leaves - everyone quit."
  explanation: "This joke combines technical terminology (tree topology, branches) with workplace humor. The punchline subverts the expected technical explanation by revealing it's actually about employee retention, using 'leaves' as a double meaning."
  rating: 8

- text: "TCP and UDP walk into a bar. The bartender says 'What'll it be?' TCP says 'I'll have a beer.' UDP says 'Beer!' and leaves."
  explanation: "This illustrates the difference between connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) protocols. TCP's polite response represents its handshake mechanism, while UDP's abrupt departure demonstrates its 'fire and forget' nature without confirmation."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my packets to take the scenic route. Now they're lost and asking for directions at every router."
  explanation: "This personifies data packets and plays with the concept of routing algorithms. The humor comes from applying human behavior (sightseeing, getting lost) to the deterministic process of packet forwarding through network nodes."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't network engineers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including the OSI model."
  explanation: "This combines a classic science joke with networking knowledge. It creates meta-humor by suggesting even fundamental networking concepts like the OSI model are arbitrary constructs, while playing on the double meaning of 'make up'."
  rating: 6

- text: "My subnet mask walked into a party. Nobody recognized it because it was wearing 255.255.255.0."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes a subnet mask and uses the technical notation as a 'disguise.' The humor lies in treating the numerical representation as literal clothing, creating absurdity through applying human social situations to networking concepts."
  rating: 5

- text: "There are 10 types of people in networking: those who understand binary, those who don't, and those who didn't expect a base-3 joke."
  explanation: "This is a meta-joke that subverts the classic binary joke format by introducing a third option, which itself contradicts the binary premise. It creates layers of humor through self-reference and violated expectations."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the network packet go to school? To get a better education... but it dropped out."
  explanation: "This uses 'packet drop' terminology as a punchline, with double meaning. The setup creates expectations about self-improvement, which gets subverted by the technical reality of packet loss in networks."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my network switch how it was doing. It said 'I'm feeling very Layer 2 today' - apparently it wasn't ready for deep conversations."
  explanation: "This plays on the OSI model layers, where Layer 2 (Data Link) is relatively low-level. The humor comes from equating technical abstraction levels with emotional depth, suggesting superficial communication."
  rating: 8

- text: "A broadcast storm walks into a network. Then it walks into every network. And every network. And every network..."
  explanation: "This demonstrates the self-propagating, uncontrolled nature of broadcast storms through repetitive structure. The joke itself mimics the problem it describes, using form to reinforce content in a recursive humor pattern."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the network administrator break up with DNS? She couldn't resolve their relationship."
  explanation: "This uses 'resolve' as a double meaning - both the technical DNS resolution process and the emotional concept of resolving conflicts. The wordplay creates a bridge between technical and romantic contexts."
  rating: 7

- text: "My ping to localhost failed. I think I'm having an existential crisis."
  explanation: "This creates deep humor by suggesting that inability to connect to oneself (localhost/127.0.0.1) represents a philosophical crisis of self-identity. It elevates a technical failure to existential proportions through absurdist comparison."
  rating: 9

- text: "How does a network engineer propose? 'Will you accept my SYN request? I promise to ACK your every need.'"
  explanation: "This transforms the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) into romantic language. The technical precision of the protocol becomes a metaphor for commitment and communication in relationships."
  rating: 8

- text: "I implemented a mesh network topology for my family communication. Now everyone talks to everyone, and nothing gets done."
  explanation: "This applies network topology concepts to human social dynamics. The joke highlights how full connectivity (mesh topology) can create communication overhead, mirroring real organizational problems through technical metaphor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't routers ever win arguments? Because they always see both sides and just forward the problem."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes routers' packet-forwarding function as conflict avoidance. The humor comes from presenting a technical necessity (routing between networks) as a personality flaw (inability to take sides)."
  rating: 6

- text: "A network engineer's last words: 'Don't worry, the redundancy will kick in.' Narrator: The redundancy did not kick in."
  explanation: "This uses dramatic irony and the narrator format to create dark humor about single points of failure. It plays on the gap between theoretical network design and practical implementation failures."
  rating: 8

- text: "My network has imposter syndrome. It keeps sending ARP requests asking 'Who am I really?'"
  explanation: "This elevates ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests, which map IP addresses to MAC addresses, into a psychological condition. The technical process of identity verification becomes a metaphor for self-doubt."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to explain network latency to my boss using interpretive dance. There was a significant delay before he understood. Then he fired me."
  explanation: "This creates multi-layered humor: the absurdity of using dance to explain latency, the meta-joke of experiencing latency in the explanation itself, and the realistic consequence of workplace inappropriateness. The structure builds complexity through escalation."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the network cable go to the gym? To improve its bandwidth. Now it's a thick ethernet cable with impressive throughput."
  explanation: "This personifies network cables and treats physical cable thickness (which actually affects bandwidth) as muscular development. The technical accuracy underlying the absurd metaphor creates sophisticated wordplay."
  rating: 7

- text: "A photon checks into a hotel. The bellhop asks 'Any luggage?' The photon replies 'No, I'm traveling light.' Meanwhile, the fiber optic cable in the wall whispers 'Amateur.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines physics humor with networking technology. It starts with a classic setup but adds a third layer where fiber optics, which actually transmit light for data, one-ups the photon joke. The meta-humor and technical depth create multiple levels of appreciation, from casual observers to networking experts."
