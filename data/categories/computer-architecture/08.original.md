- text: "My CPU's branch predictor is so good, it already knew I'd make this joke."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the concept of branch prediction in modern CPUs, which try to guess which way conditional code will execute. The humor comes from applying this technical optimization to human behavior, suggesting the CPU predicted the speaker's own actions."

- text: "Why did the cache miss feel lonely? It couldn't find anyone in its line."
  explanation: "A pun on 'cache line' (a unit of data transfer between cache and memory) and the social concept of waiting 'in line.' Cache misses occur when requested data isn't found in cache, creating a double meaning of both technical and social isolation."

- text: "I tried to explain pipelining to my friend, but there were too many stalls in the conversation."
  explanation: "Pipeline stalls occur when a CPU pipeline has to wait for data or resolve dependencies. The joke applies this technical concept to human communication, where conversational 'stalls' are awkward pauses."

- text: "The memory hierarchy went to therapy because it had too many levels of commitment issues."
  explanation: "Memory hierarchy (registers, cache, RAM, disk) involves multiple levels with different speeds and capacities. The joke personifies this structure as having psychological 'commitment issues' with its multiple layers."

- text: "Why don't CPUs ever get lost? They always follow their instruction pointer."
  explanation: "The instruction pointer (or program counter) is a register that keeps track of where the CPU is in program execution. The joke treats this as a GPS-like navigation system for the CPU."

- text: "My out-of-order execution unit is so aggressive, it finished tomorrow's work yesterday."
  explanation: "Out-of-order execution allows CPUs to execute instructions in a different order than programmed for efficiency. The joke exaggerates this to absurdity by suggesting it violates temporal causality."

- text: "A register walked into a bar. The bartender said, 'What'll it be?' The register replied, 'Just 64 bits, I'm watching my width.'"
  explanation: "Registers have specific bit widths (32-bit, 64-bit, etc.). The joke plays on 'watching your weight' transformed into 'watching your width,' applying dietary concerns to computer architecture."

- text: "Why did the RISC processor break up with the CISC processor? Too many complex instructions in the relationship."
  explanation: "RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) uses simple instructions while CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) uses complex ones. The joke frames this architectural difference as a relationship incompatibility."

- text: "I told my CPU to take a break, but it said it was already in a wait state."
  explanation: "A wait state is when a CPU pauses execution waiting for slower memory. The joke treats this technical state as the CPU's version of 'taking a break,' creating a humorous misunderstanding."

- text: "The L1 cache and L3 cache got into an argument. L1 said, 'I'm closer to the action!' L3 replied, 'Yeah, but I've got more space for the relationship.'"
  explanation: "L1 cache is small but fast and close to the CPU core, while L3 is larger but slower and farther away. The joke personifies them as competing for the CPU's attention with their respective advantages."

- text: "Why did the speculative execution unit get fired? It kept jumping to conclusions before checking if they were correct."
  explanation: "Speculative execution executes instructions before knowing if they're needed, sometimes causing security issues (like Spectre). The joke applies this technical behavior to poor workplace judgment."

- text: "My TLB is so small, it forgets where it put things before it even finishes looking."
  explanation: "The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) caches virtual-to-physical address translations. A small TLB causes frequent misses. The joke exaggerates this limitation to human-like forgetfulness at an absurd level."

- text: "A von Neumann architecture and a Harvard architecture walked into a bar. Von Neumann said, 'I'll have what the data's having.' Harvard said, 'I keep my drinks and food separate, thank you.'"
  explanation: "Von Neumann architecture shares memory for instructions and data, while Harvard architecture separates them. The joke frames this as different approaches to ordering at a bar, with Harvard being particular about separation."

- text: "Why don't superscalar processors ever finish a conversation? They're always starting multiple threads at once and forgetting which one they were on."
  explanation: "Superscalar processors can execute multiple instructions simultaneously. The joke applies this parallel execution capability to human conversation, creating a humorous image of someone unable to focus."

- text: "I asked my CPU how it handles so many tasks. It said, 'Context switching—I just pretend to care about each one for a few nanoseconds.'"
  explanation: "Context switching is when a CPU rapidly switches between tasks to create the illusion of multitasking. The joke anthropomorphizes this as insincere attention, like someone pretending to listen."

- text: "The write-back cache was always procrastinating. 'I'll update main memory later,' it said. Then the power went out."
  explanation: "Write-back caches delay writing to main memory for performance but risk data loss on power failure. The joke frames this as procrastination with real consequences, making it relatable."

- text: "Why did the branch predictor go to Vegas? It was already gambling on every conditional anyway."
  explanation: "Branch predictors make educated guesses about which way branches will go, essentially 'betting' on outcomes. The joke extends this gambling metaphor to its logical extreme—actual gambling in Vegas."

- text: "A CISC instruction walked into a bar and ordered a drink, paid for it, left a tip, called a cab, and updated its Facebook status. A RISC instruction walked in and said, 'Beer.' The bartender asked which one was more efficient. The bar is still debating."
  explanation: "This joke captures the classic RISC vs CISC debate: CISC instructions do many things at once (complex), while RISC instructions do one thing simply. The ongoing debate in the bar mirrors decades of real architectural arguments."

- text: "My CPU's thermal throttling is so aggressive, it slows down when I just think about compiling large projects."
  explanation: "Thermal throttling reduces CPU speed when it gets too hot. The joke absurdly suggests it's so sensitive it reacts to the mere thought of intensive work, before any actual heat is generated."

- text: "Why did the cache coherency protocol go to couples therapy? It couldn't handle all the invalidation in its relationships."
  explanation: "Cache coherency protocols ensure consistency across multiple caches, often by invalidating cached copies. The joke brilliantly applies this technical 'invalidation' to emotional invalidation in relationships, creating a multi-layered pun."

- text: "A quantum computer and a classical CPU met at a conference. The CPU said, 'I just finished calculating that problem.' The quantum computer replied, 'Interesting—I'm still in superposition about whether I've started.' Later, someone observed it, and it had both finished and not started simultaneously. The CPU filed a complaint with HR about unclear work boundaries."
  explanation: "This joke combines quantum computing concepts (superposition, observation) with classical architecture, creating an absurd workplace scenario. The humor works on multiple levels: the quantum computer's impossible state, the CPU's confusion, and the mundane HR complaint about something fundamentally impossible to adjudicate. It's funny because it treats mind-bending quantum physics as just another annoying coworker behavior."
