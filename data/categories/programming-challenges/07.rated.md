- text: "I entered a coding competition. My solution was O(n²). So was my placement."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'O(n²)' - both as algorithmic complexity notation and as a poor ranking. The humor comes from the self-deprecating parallel between inefficient code and poor competition results."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer fail the puzzle challenge? He kept trying to brute force his way through life."
  explanation: "This plays on 'brute force' as both a legitimate algorithmic approach and a metaphor for lacking elegance. The incongruity comes from applying a programming strategy to general life situations."
  rating: 6

- text: "Algorithmic problems are like relationships - everyone says communication is O(1), but mine always ends up O(n log n)."
  explanation: "This joke uses Big O notation to describe relationship complexity, creating humor through the unexpected application of technical concepts to personal life, while also suggesting increasing difficulty over time."
  rating: 7

- text: "I solved a LeetCode hard problem in one sitting. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "Classic setup-punchline structure that builds expectation of achievement, then deflates it with the revelation it was just a dream, reflecting the difficulty many face with challenging algorithmic problems."
  rating: 7

- text: "My debugging strategy in competitions: panic first, optimize later."
  explanation: "This inverts the standard 'make it work, then make it fast' principle, using self-deprecating humor to acknowledge the stress of timed coding challenges."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's a competitive programmer's favorite exercise? Running through test cases."
  explanation: "A pun on 'running' as both physical exercise and executing code, with 'test cases' being the programming equivalent of a workout routine."
  rating: 5

- text: "I participated in a 24-hour hackathon. Coded for 2 hours, debugged for 22."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates the common frustration of spending far more time debugging than actually writing code, using the relief theory to address a shared pain point in programming competitions."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't competitive programmers trust stairs? They prefer to take steps in O(1) time."
  explanation: "This creates humor by personifying programmers' obsession with efficiency, suggesting they'd want constant-time access even for physical activities like climbing stairs."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code passed all sample test cases. Then the hidden tests attacked like it was Pearl Harbor."
  explanation: "This uses military imagery to dramatize the common experience of code failing on hidden test cases after succeeding on visible ones, creating humor through exaggerated comparison."
  rating: 4

- text: "I wrote a recursive solution so elegant it made me cry. Then it stack overflowed."
  explanation: "The joke builds up pride in elegant code, then immediately deflates it with a common pitfall of recursive solutions, using the setup-punchline structure effectively."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call a programmer who solves every problem with dynamic programming? Memoized."
  explanation: "A clever pun playing on 'memoized' (a DP technique) and 'memorized' (suggesting they've memorized one approach), with the double meaning that they're stuck in their ways."
  rating: 9

- text: "Coding competitions taught me that my greatest enemy isn't other programmers - it's off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory inversely, suggesting that the real opponent is a simple programming mistake rather than human competitors, which is both relatable and self-deprecating."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the algorithm go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies and kept getting stuck in cycles."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes code problems as psychological issues, creating humor through the unexpected parallel between graph theory concepts and mental health terminology."
  rating: 8

- text: "I optimized my solution from O(n³) to O(n²). The judge optimized my score from 50 to 51."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the frustration of significant effort yielding minimal results, using parallel structure and specific numbers to emphasize the disproportionate outcome."
  rating: 9

- text: "My approach to coding puzzles: read problem, think deeply, submit random solution, debug based on which test cases fail. I call it Test-Driven Guessing."
  explanation: "This parodies Test-Driven Development while honestly describing a chaotic problem-solving approach, creating humor through the contrast between methodical terminology and random practice."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a coding competition and a horror movie? In horror movies, you know the monster is coming."
  explanation: "This comparison creates humor by suggesting that hidden test cases are more terrifying than predictable movie monsters, using exaggeration to express a common fear."
  rating: 7

- text: "I solved a graph problem using BFS. The optimal solution was DFS. I solved another using DFS. That one needed BFS. I'm starting to think the universe is mocking me."
  explanation: "This captures the frustrating experience of consistently choosing the wrong approach, building through repetition and culminating in a paranoid conclusion that adds absurdity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do competitive programmers make terrible comedians? Their jokes only work for edge cases, and nobody tests those."
  explanation: "This meta-joke about programming humor itself uses the concept of edge cases to explain why technical jokes might not land with general audiences, creating layered humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "I entered a competition where you had to solve problems in alphabetical order. I got stuck on problem A. At least I was consistently bad."
  explanation: "The self-deprecating humor comes from failing at the very first step, with the punchline acknowledging that total failure is at least predictable, using absurdity for effect."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code in competitions: 90% comments explaining why it doesn't work, 10% code that proves those comments right."
  explanation: "This inverts the usual complaint about lack of documentation, suggesting the documentation is actually a confession of failure, creating humor through unexpected honesty and self-awareness."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally understood the optimal solution to a problem - three days after the competition ended, in the shower, while singing. I've concluded that competitive programming is just expensive shower thoughts with a time limit."
  explanation: "This captures the universal experience of post-competition clarity, using the absurd image of shower-time epiphanies to reframe the entire competitive programming experience as an elaborate setup for delayed realizations, combining multiple humor theories with perfect timing."
