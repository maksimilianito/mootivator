- text: "UDP tells a joke. TCP asks if you got it."
  explanation: "This plays on the fundamental difference between UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which sends data without confirmation, and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) which ensures delivery through acknowledgments. The joke structure mirrors their behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did HTTP go to therapy? It had too many issues with commitment."
  explanation: "HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning it doesn't maintain connections between requests. This is humorously compared to commitment issues in relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "ICMP walked into a bar. The bartender said 'We don't serve your type here.' ICMP replied, 'Destination unreachable.'"
  explanation: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) sends error messages like 'Destination Unreachable.' The joke applies this technical response to a social rejection scenario."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my friend a joke about IPv4 address exhaustion. He didn't get it—there wasn't enough space."
  explanation: "IPv4 has a limited address space (about 4.3 billion addresses), which has been exhausted. The double meaning of 'space' refers both to address availability and comedic timing."
  rating: 8

- text: "DNS: The protocol that turns 'I know where that is' into a three-day treasure hunt."
  explanation: "DNS (Domain Name System) should quickly resolve domain names to IP addresses, but DNS issues are notoriously difficult to troubleshoot, often taking much longer than expected."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a network engineer's favorite dance? The TCP handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, and you're connected!"
  explanation: "The TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) is the process for establishing a connection. It's humorously compared to a dance routine with specific steps."
  rating: 6

- text: "ARP keeps asking 'Who has this IP?' Sounds like my manager in every meeting."
  explanation: "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) broadcasts 'Who has IP address X?' to find MAC addresses. This is compared to a manager constantly asking who's responsible for tasks."
  rating: 7

- text: "My favorite protocol is HTTPS. It's like HTTP but with trust issues and a security guard."
  explanation: "HTTPS is HTTP with SSL/TLS encryption added for security. The joke personifies this as HTTP being paranoid and needing protection."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't UDP packets ever get invited to parties? Because nobody knows if they'll show up."
  explanation: "UDP is unreliable and doesn't guarantee packet delivery. This uncertainty is compared to an unreliable party guest."
  rating: 8

- text: "FTP is that friend who insists on using two phone lines for one conversation."
  explanation: "FTP (File Transfer Protocol) uses two separate connections—one for commands and one for data transfer—which is inefficient by modern standards."
  rating: 7

- text: "SMTP tried to send a letter but got rejected. 'Relay access denied,' they said. Even email has trust issues now."
  explanation: "SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) relay restrictions prevent unauthorized email forwarding. This security measure is humorously compared to social trust issues."
  rating: 6

- text: "A packet walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll you have?' The packet replies, 'Just passing through—I'm UDP.'"
  explanation: "This plays on UDP's connectionless nature where packets simply pass through without establishing a relationship (connection) with the destination."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the network engineer break up with TCP? Too clingy. Every message needed acknowledgment."
  explanation: "TCP requires acknowledgment for every packet, ensuring reliable delivery. This is humorously compared to a clingy relationship where everything needs confirmation."
  rating: 8

- text: "DHCP is like a hotel receptionist who assigns you a room but might give it to someone else when you check out. Sometimes while you're still in it."
  explanation: "DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses with lease times, and addresses can be reassigned. The joke exaggerates this by comparing it to being kicked out of a hotel room unexpectedly."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked IPv6 to tell me a joke. It gave me 340 undecillion variations. I'm still listening."
  explanation: "IPv6 has approximately 340 undecillion possible addresses (3.4 × 10^38), a number so large it's almost incomprehensible. The joke plays on this massive scale."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why is BGP the most dramatic protocol? Because when it has a problem, it tells everyone in the world about it."
  explanation: "BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routes internet traffic globally, and when BGP issues occur, they can cause widespread internet outages affecting millions. The joke compares this to dramatic oversharing."
  rating: 8

- text: "TCP and UDP walked into a bar. The bartender only saw TCP because UDP didn't wait for acknowledgment to enter."
  explanation: "This combines the setup-punchline structure with the fundamental difference between protocols: TCP waits for acknowledgment while UDP just sends data without caring if it arrives."
  rating: 7

- text: "My therapist asked about my childhood. I said, 'It's complicated—like trying to explain NAT to my parents.'"
  explanation: "NAT (Network Address Translation) is notoriously difficult to explain to non-technical people. The joke equates this complexity with the complexity of family relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the packet go to therapy? It had severe fragmentation issues and couldn't keep itself together anymore."
  explanation: "IP fragmentation splits large packets into smaller pieces for transmission. This technical process is brilliantly compared to psychological fragmentation and mental health struggles."
  rating: 9

- text: "A SYN packet walks into a bar. Bartender says 'SYN-ACK.' The packet never responds. 'Great,' sighs the bartender, 'another half-open connection ruining my evening.'"
  explanation: "This describes a SYN flood attack where connection requests are never completed, leaving half-open connections that consume resources. The bartender's frustration mirrors a server's resource exhaustion."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my wife I was learning about the OSI model. She said, 'That's great honey, which layer are we on?' I said, 'Layer 8—the political layer.' She divorced me at Layer 9—the financial layer."
  explanation: "The OSI model officially has 7 layers, but IT professionals joke about Layer 8 (user/political) and Layer 9 (financial/organizational) as the real sources of problems. This joke extends the model to relationship dynamics, creating multiple levels of humor."
