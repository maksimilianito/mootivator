- text: "My CS professor said we'd learn to think like computers. Now I can't decide if I'm hungry without a flowchart."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory by applying computational thinking (flowcharts) to a basic human need (hunger). It plays on the common CS education trope that students are taught to break down every problem into logical steps, humorously suggesting this extends to everyday life."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS student bring a ladder to lecture? To reach higher-level programming."
  explanation: "A simple pun exploiting the double meaning of 'higher-level' - both literally climbing higher and the programming concept of high-level languages. The setup creates a physical expectation that's resolved with a technical punchline."
  rating: 4

- text: "My data structures course taught me that life is like a stack: you can only deal with the thing on top, and everything else just piles up underneath."
  explanation: "This applies the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle of stack data structures to life problems, using the technical concept as a metaphor for procrastination and stress accumulation common in student life."
  rating: 8

- text: "In CS class, they taught us recursion. To understand it, we first had to understand recursion."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that demonstrates recursion by defining itself recursively. It captures the initial confusion students feel when first encountering recursive concepts, using the structure of the joke to mirror the concept itself."
  rating: 9

- text: "My CS curriculum had so many prerequisites, I needed a prerequisite just to understand the prerequisite tree."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to highlight the complex dependency chains in CS programs, while also referencing tree data structures. It reflects the real frustration students face when planning their course schedules."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a CS degree and a philosophy degree? About $50,000 a year, but the same amount of existential crisis."
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke that uses self-deprecating humor about both fields. It acknowledges CS's practical value while admitting that even technical education doesn't solve life's big questions."
  rating: 8

- text: "My professor said 'There are 10 types of students in this class.' I dropped out before hearing about the other 8."
  explanation: "This misdirection joke sets up the classic binary joke (10 in binary = 2 in decimal) but subverts it by having the narrator misunderstand, demonstrating exactly the kind of student who struggles with CS concepts."
  rating: 9

- text: "CS education: where 'Hello World' takes 5 minutes, but understanding why it works takes 5 years."
  explanation: "Highlights the gap between doing and understanding in CS education. The incongruity between the simplicity of the first program and the depth of knowledge required to truly understand it reflects a genuine learning experience."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't CS professors ever get lost? They always know their way around a tree traversal."
  explanation: "A straightforward pun connecting navigation skills with tree data structure algorithms (traversal methods). It personifies professors as living their technical knowledge."
  rating: 5

- text: "My algorithms professor proved that finding a parking spot on campus is NP-complete. We're still waiting for his polynomial-time solution."
  explanation: "This applies computational complexity theory to a relatable campus problem. It requires understanding of NP-complete problems and implies the problem is essentially unsolvable efficiently, which resonates with student parking frustrations."
  rating: 9

- text: "I learned more about debugging in one semester of CS projects than in four years of debugging my life choices."
  explanation: "Uses the relief theory by comparing technical debugging with life decisions. The self-deprecating humor acknowledges that CS skills don't necessarily translate to better personal decision-making."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the CS curriculum include so much math? Because without it, students might accidentally create something that works on the first try."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor suggesting that mathematical rigor exists to ensure proper suffering. It plays on the stereotype that CS projects never work initially and the debate over how much math CS students actually need."
  rating: 6

- text: "My operating systems course was so realistic, the professor's lectures would randomly crash and we'd have to reboot the class."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that applies OS concepts to the classroom itself. The joke works on multiple levels - both as commentary on OS reliability and potentially as a real technical difficulty in modern classrooms."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a CS student who actually reads the textbook? A graduate student who's now teaching the course."
  explanation: "This uses temporal misdirection - setting up an expectation about undergraduate behavior and revealing that only those who become instructors actually read thoroughly. Commentary on academic culture and learning shortcuts."
  rating: 8

- text: "My discrete math professor said the course would be 'fun and intuitive.' That was my first lesson in identifying false statements."
  explanation: "Self-referential humor that uses logic concepts (false statements) to comment on the course itself. It captures the common experience of finding discrete math challenging despite promises otherwise, while demonstrating logical thinking."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CS department install a revolving door? So students could experience circular dependencies in real life before encountering them in code."
  explanation: "Physical metaphor for a programming concept. The absurdity lies in the deliberate architectural choice to teach a frustrating concept, while also commenting on students constantly entering and leaving the building."
  rating: 7

- text: "In my software engineering class, we spent six weeks planning a project and two days coding it. The professor called it 'industry preparation.'"
  explanation: "Satirical commentary on both academic approaches and industry practices. The incongruity between planning time and execution time reflects real debates about software methodology while being relatable to students eager to code."
  rating: 8

- text: "My CS advisor told me to 'follow my passion.' I'm now passionately debugging segmentation faults at 3 AM, so I guess it worked."
  explanation: "Dark humor using the relief theory. It subverts the inspirational career advice by showing the unglamorous reality of CS work, while the self-aware tone suggests acceptance of this fate."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a CS lecture and a GitHub repository? The repository actually has useful comments."
  explanation: "Comparative humor that criticizes both poor code documentation and unclear lectures simultaneously. Works through shared experience of both students (confusing lectures) and developers (uncommented code)."
  rating: 7

- text: "My computer architecture professor taught us about cache memory by never returning our graded assignments. 'They're cached somewhere,' he'd say. We learned a lot about cache invalidation."
  explanation: "Sophisticated joke that uses a real-world analogy for a technical concept while critiquing professorial disorganization. The punchline about cache invalidation (one of CS's 'hard problems') adds a meta-layer about lost data."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the CS department's graduation rate improve? They finally implemented garbage collection for failed students. Now they just get recycled into the next semester."
  explanation: "Dark absurdist humor applying memory management concepts to student retention. The joke works through the uncomfortable parallel between disposing of unused objects and handling struggling students, while maintaining a playful tone through the technical metaphor."
