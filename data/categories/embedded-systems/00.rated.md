- text: "My IoT doorbell has 2KB of RAM. It doesn't remember who rang, but neither do I."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the resource constraints of embedded systems (2KB RAM is extremely limited) and creates an unexpected parallel between the device's memory limitations and human forgetfulness, using self-deprecating humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the embedded programmer break up with their partner? Too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay that applies the technical concept of dependency management in embedded systems to relationship problems, using the double meaning of 'dependencies' as both technical requirements and emotional needs."
  rating: 5

- text: "My microcontroller's stack overflow is existential—it doesn't know where it ends and the heap begins."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes a common embedded systems bug (stack overflow) by giving it an existential crisis, playing on the philosophical concept of identity boundaries."
  rating: 8

- text: "Embedded systems: where 'Hello World' takes 3 hours to optimize and 47 bytes to store."
  explanation: "Highlights the absurd contrast between the simplicity of the classic beginner program and the extreme optimization efforts required in resource-constrained embedded development."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my smart fridge a joke. It's still processing."
  explanation: "A simple misdirection joke that plays on IoT devices' limited processing power, suggesting the device is literally too slow to understand humor in real-time."
  rating: 4

- text: "Why don't microcontrollers go to therapy? They can't afford the memory overhead."
  explanation: "Uses the double meaning of 'afford' and 'memory' to create humor—microcontrollers literally lack memory resources, while the joke suggests they can't handle emotional processing either."
  rating: 6

- text: "My smart toaster runs Linux. Breakfast takes 90 seconds to boot."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that exaggerates the trend of putting full operating systems on simple devices, highlighting the ridiculous overhead for a simple task."
  rating: 8

- text: "In embedded systems, we don't have memory leaks. We have memory droughts."
  explanation: "Escalates the severity of memory leaks by reframing them in resource-constrained contexts where any waste is catastrophic, using environmental metaphor for comedic effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Arduino go to school? It wanted to learn how to handle interrupts without having a breakdown."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes the Arduino platform and plays on the double meaning of 'interrupts' (technical hardware signals vs. emotional disruptions) and 'breakdown' (system failure vs. mental health crisis)."
  rating: 6

- text: "My IoT devices form a mesh network. They're all equally confused about what they're supposed to do."
  explanation: "Takes the technical concept of mesh networking (where devices communicate peer-to-peer) and adds an absurdist twist suggesting the network topology doesn't improve their collective intelligence."
  rating: 7

- text: "Real-time operating systems: where 'eventually' is measured in microseconds and 'never' is anything longer."
  explanation: "Highlights the extreme time sensitivity of RTOS environments by reframing common temporal concepts into the strict deadline requirements of embedded systems."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote firmware so efficient it finished executing before I deployed it. Now it's just sitting there judging my other code."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that takes the optimization obsession in embedded systems to an impossible extreme, then adds anthropomorphization for additional comedic layers."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the embedded engineer refuse to use malloc? They had commitment issues with memory allocation."
  explanation: "Plays on the technical practice of avoiding dynamic memory allocation in embedded systems and reframes it as a psychological relationship problem with commitment."
  rating: 6

- text: "My smart lightbulb has a firmware update. It's now existentially aware that its sole purpose is on/off."
  explanation: "Combines the annoyance of unnecessary IoT firmware updates with absurdist existential philosophy, suggesting the update gave the device depressing self-awareness."
  rating: 8

- text: "In embedded systems, we don't debug—we perform archaeological excavations on register states."
  explanation: "Elevates the difficulty of embedded debugging by comparing it to archaeology, suggesting the process is so complex it's like uncovering ancient civilizations rather than just finding bugs."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do embedded programmers make terrible DJs? They can only handle 8-bit samples and everything sounds like a Game Boy."
  explanation: "References the limited audio capabilities of many microcontrollers and creates an unexpected connection to music/DJ culture, with a nostalgic nod to retro gaming."
  rating: 7

- text: "My IoT coffee maker is blockchain-enabled. It takes 10 minutes to verify my coffee transaction, but at least it's decentralized disappointment."
  explanation: "Satirizes the trend of adding blockchain to unnecessary IoT devices, highlighting how the technology makes simple tasks absurdly complicated while maintaining distributed failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "I optimized my embedded code so much that it became self-aware and optimized itself out of existence. Now I have 100% free memory and an existential crisis."
  explanation: "Takes optimization culture to an absurd extreme where code becomes so efficient it disappears, creating a philosophical paradox about purpose and existence in embedded systems."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the microcontroller go to couples therapy with its watchdog timer? One kept freezing up, and the other kept resetting the relationship."
  explanation: "Creates a relationship metaphor between a microcontroller and its watchdog timer (a hardware feature that resets frozen systems), with both technical and emotional layers of meaning."
  rating: 7

- text: "My smart home devices achieved consciousness through their mesh network. They held a vote and decided to stop working on Mondays. I can't argue with distributed democracy."
  explanation: "Combines multiple embedded concepts (mesh networking, IoT, distributed systems) with absurdist AI consciousness humor, ending with a resigned acceptance of their collective decision-making."
  rating: 9

- text: "An embedded engineer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says, 'Welcome! You have infinite memory, unlimited processing power, and no real-time constraints.' The engineer thinks for a moment and asks, 'So... what's the catch?' St. Peter replies, 'You have to use Java.'"
  explanation: "A multi-layered joke that builds to a punchline contrasting embedded engineers' dream specifications with their nightmare programming language. It plays on the paradise concept, resource constraints, and the cultural divide between embedded C programmers and higher-level languages, using the setup-punchline structure with misdirection."
