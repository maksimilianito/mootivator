- text: "Documentation: where dreams of clarity go to become TODO comments."
  explanation: This joke plays on the common reality that documentation is often neglected or incomplete, with developers leaving TODO markers that never get addressed, contrasting the ideal of clear documentation with the messy reality.

- text: "Why did the API documentation go to therapy? It had too many unresolved references."
  explanation: This uses wordplay on "unresolved references" which is both a technical term for broken links in documentation and a psychological term for emotional issues, creating incongruity through applying technical concepts to human situations.

- text: "The best documentation is the code itself, said every developer who's never read their own code six months later."
  explanation: This joke uses irony and superiority theory, mocking the common excuse developers make for not writing documentation while highlighting the reality that even self-documenting code becomes incomprehensible over time.

- text: "I started writing documentation. Then I woke up."
  explanation: A brief absurdist joke suggesting that writing documentation is so rare it could only happen in a dream, using exaggeration to highlight developers' notorious aversion to documentation tasks.

- text: "How do you know a developer actually wrote documentation? Check the commit history—it's the one marked 'Fixed typo' from three years ago."
  explanation: This joke uses misdirection and observational humor about documentation being so rarely updated that the only evidence of its existence is an ancient typo fix, highlighting neglect through specific detail.

- text: "Documentation is like a gym membership: everyone agrees it's important, pays for it, but nobody actually uses it."
  explanation: This analogy-based joke uses the incongruity between stated values and actual behavior, comparing documentation to another commonly neglected good intention that creates cognitive dissonance.

- text: "Why don't developers write documentation? Because they're too busy answering the same questions on Slack."
  explanation: This ironic joke highlights the paradox that developers spend more time repeatedly answering questions than they would spend writing documentation once, using the relief theory to address a common workplace frustration.

- text: "Our documentation is so good, it explains everything except how to use the software."
  explanation: This joke uses absurdist humor and irony, suggesting documentation that fails at its primary purpose while technically being comprehensive, highlighting the disconnect between documentation volume and usefulness.

- text: "I found a bug in the documentation—it existed."
  explanation: A short, punchy joke using unexpected reversal where the existence of documentation itself is treated as the error, playing on the rarity of documentation and treating its presence as anomalous.

- text: "What's the difference between documentation and fiction? Fiction has to be believable."
  explanation: This comparison joke suggests that documentation is often so outdated or incorrect that it's less credible than fiction, using superiority theory to mock poor documentation quality through exaggeration.

- text: "Step 1: Write code. Step 2: Document code. Step 3: Wake up, realize you're still on Step 1."
  explanation: This multi-step joke uses the dream/reality reversal pattern to show how documentation never actually happens, with the punchline revealing the aspirational nature of the documentation step.

- text: "Why did the technical writer quit? They were asked to document a system that only existed in the developers' imaginations."
  explanation: This joke plays on the common problem of documentation being requested before implementation, or for vaporware, creating humor through the absurdity of documenting non-existent systems.

- text: "Our API documentation is perfectly clear: it clearly states 'See source code for details.'"
  explanation: This joke uses ironic reversal where documentation that points back to code defeats its own purpose, highlighting lazy documentation practices through circular logic that creates incongruity.

- text: "How many developers does it take to update documentation? Unknown—the experiment is still running."
  explanation: This light-bulb joke variant suggests that documentation updates take so long they're effectively infinite, using the scientific experiment framing to add humor through formality applied to a mundane task.

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation once. The code changed the next day, and now the docs are historical fiction."
  explanation: This joke addresses the real frustration of documentation becoming obsolete immediately, using the "historical fiction" categorization to humorously acknowledge that outdated docs are essentially creative writing.

- text: "Why is documentation like a unicorn? Everyone talks about it, some claim to have seen it, but nobody can prove it exists."
  explanation: This extended metaphor compares documentation to mythical creatures, using the incongruity of treating a mundane technical artifact as legendary to emphasize how rarely good documentation appears.

- text: "My documentation has more 'Coming Soon' sections than a movie trailer website."
  explanation: This comparison creates humor through the absurdity of documentation that promises future content but never delivers, similar to perpetually delayed features, using exaggeration and cultural reference.

- text: "What do you call documentation that's actually up to date? A bug—report it immediately."
  explanation: This joke inverts the normal meaning of "bug" to suggest that correct, current documentation is so abnormal it must be an error, using paradox and absurdity for comedic effect.

- text: "I asked for the documentation. They sent me a link to a YouTube video from 2015 of a guy mumbling while his cat walks across the keyboard. It was still the most helpful resource available."
  explanation: This story-format joke uses vivid, absurd imagery to critique poor documentation practices while acknowledging that even terrible resources are often the best available, creating humor through painful relatability and exaggeration.

- text: "Why did the documentation file go to the bar? To get some comments—it hadn't received any since it was created."
  explanation: This anthropomorphic joke plays on the double meaning of "comments" (social interaction vs. code comments), while highlighting that documentation is often ignored, using wordplay and the relief theory about a common frustration.

- text: "The company hired a technical writer, and on their first day, they asked to see the documentation. The developers laughed so hard, three of them had to take sick leave. The technical writer was promoted to management for discovering the best morale booster in company history."
  explanation: This extended narrative joke builds through escalating absurdity—from the naive request, to the extreme reaction, to the paradoxical promotion—creating humor through the complete inversion of expectations and acknowledging documentation as such a foreign concept it becomes comedy gold.
