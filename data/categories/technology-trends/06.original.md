```yaml
- text: "Upgraded to the latest framework. Now debugging the upgrade instead of building features."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the irony of technology adoption - the promise of improvement often leads to immediate setbacks. It uses the incongruity between expectation (productivity boost) and reality (more work)."

- text: "Why did the startup pivot three times in one year? They were agile."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'agile' - both the software development methodology and the business practice of rapidly changing direction. The humor comes from the absurd extreme of the agile philosophy."

- text: "My smartwatch told me to stand up. I'm now taking orders from my wrist."
  explanation: "This joke uses superiority theory by highlighting how we've become subservient to our technology. The absurdity of taking commands from a watch creates the humorous incongruity."

- text: "Blockchain will revolutionize everything! Except the things it won't. Which is most things."
  explanation: "This employs misdirection - starting with typical tech hype before deflating it with reality. It satirizes the tendency to overstate new technology's impact."

- text: "What's the difference between AI in 2020 and AI in 2024? Marketing budget."
  explanation: "This uses cynical humor to suggest that progress in AI is more about promotion than actual advancement, playing on the relief theory by expressing a common frustration with tech hype."

- text: "Remember when 'the cloud' just meant rain was coming?"
  explanation: "This nostalgic joke contrasts the simple past with the complex present, using the double meaning of 'cloud' to highlight how rapidly technology has colonized everyday language."

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to write me a joke about technology trends. It wrote this joke. We're in a recursion now."
  explanation: "Meta-humor that references its own creation, playing with the concept of AI-generated content and recursion. The self-referential nature creates a paradox that's both clever and absurd."

- text: "Every new JavaScript framework promises to be the last one you'll ever need. There are now 47 'last frameworks you'll ever need.'"
  explanation: "This highlights the paradox of the JavaScript ecosystem's rapid evolution. The incongruity between 'last' and '47' creates humor while commenting on framework fatigue."

- text: "Why don't quantum computers replace regular computers? Because they're both working and not working until you check."
  explanation: "This applies quantum superposition to the common experience of unreliable technology, using technical knowledge to create a layered joke that works on multiple levels."

- text: "My IoT fridge ordered milk. My IoT toaster burned toast. My IoT security camera filmed it all. The future is here and it's chaotic."
  explanation: "This joke uses escalation and absurdity to show how interconnected smart devices create unexpected scenarios. The relief theory applies as it vents frustration with smart home complexity."

- text: "Web 3.0: Where everything old is new again, but now it costs gas fees."
  explanation: "This cynically suggests that Web3 innovations are just repackaged old ideas with added costs. The misdirection and double meaning of 'gas' (both metaphorical and blockchain-specific) create humor."

- text: "I don't always test my code in production, but when I do, I call it 'continuous deployment.'"
  explanation: "This plays on the meme format while satirizing how modern DevOps practices can be used to justify risky behavior. It uses superiority theory through self-deprecation."

- text: "What's the half-life of a tech stack? About six months, or until your next job interview."
  explanation: "This combines the scientific concept of half-life with the reality of rapid technological obsolescence. The dual timeline creates humorous incongruity."

- text: "Machine learning model: 99% accurate! Except for edge cases, which is 90% of reality."
  explanation: "This deflates AI hype by pointing out the gap between lab performance and real-world application. The mathematical contradiction creates the punchline."

- text: "Why did the developer learn Rust, Go, Kotlin, and Swift in one year? LinkedIn told them to."
  explanation: "This satirizes the pressure to constantly learn new technologies driven by social media and job markets. The absurdity of learning four languages in a year highlights the unrealistic expectations."

- text: "My company adopted microservices. Now instead of one thing breaking, twelve things break. Progress!"
  explanation: "This uses irony to show how architectural improvements can create new problems. The enthusiastic 'Progress!' contrasts with the obvious regression, creating humor through incongruity."

- text: "What's the difference between a tech trend and a fad? About three years and a Gartner report."
  explanation: "This cynically suggests that legitimacy in tech is arbitrary and time-based. It plays on the industry's reliance on analyst firms to validate trends."

- text: "Attended a conference on the future of work. Everyone was on their laptops working remotely from the conference hall."
  explanation: "This creates humor through situational irony - people discussing the future while already living it in an absurd way. The self-contradicting behavior highlights how quickly trends become reality."

- text: "Why do we call it 'legacy code'? Because calling it 'that thing nobody wants to touch but keeps the company running' doesn't fit on a slide."
  explanation: "This uses the misdirection pattern to reveal the uncomfortable truth behind euphemistic tech terminology. The contrast between the polite term and harsh reality creates humor."

- text: "My startup's tech stack: React, Node, MongoDB, and prayers. Mostly prayers. We're very scalable in the prayer department."
  explanation: "This builds humor through escalation and absurdity, starting with legitimate technologies before revealing the real dependency. The final line about 'scalability' applies technical jargon to something intangible."

- text: "Remember when 'AI' meant actual intelligence? Now it means 'we have an if-statement that sometimes works.' But the stock price is up, so we're all happy."
  explanation: "This multi-layered joke deflates AI hype by reducing it to basic programming, then adds cynical commentary about market valuations. The progression from technical critique to financial absurdity creates sophisticated humor that comments on multiple aspects of tech trends."
