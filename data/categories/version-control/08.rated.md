- text: "I tried to push my changes but Git said 'rejected'. Story of my life."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'rejected' - both as a Git operation failure and as a personal rejection, creating a relatable self-deprecating humor that programmers who've experienced merge conflicts can appreciate."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer always commit on Friday afternoons? He loved living dangerously."
  explanation: "This plays on the well-known developer superstition that deploying or committing code on Fridays often leads to weekend emergencies, using the incongruity between the mundane act of committing code and the concept of danger."
  rating: 8

- text: "SVN users don't have trust issues. They just centralize everything."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts the centralized nature of SVN with Git's distributed model, while playing on the psychological concept of trust issues, suggesting SVN's architecture reflects a need for control."
  rating: 6

- text: "What's a version control system's favorite exercise? Branch presses."
  explanation: "A simple pun combining the Git concept of 'branches' with the exercise 'bench press', creating humor through wordplay that's accessible even to junior developers."
  rating: 4

- text: "My code has more branches than a forest, and just as many bugs living in them."
  explanation: "This uses metaphorical extension, comparing Git branches to tree branches while incorporating the common 'bug' terminology, creating a vivid image of poorly managed version control."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't time travelers use Git? Because they always create paradoxes when they rebase history."
  explanation: "This combines the technical concept of Git rebase (rewriting history) with time travel paradoxes, creating humor through the application of programming concepts to science fiction scenarios."
  rating: 8

- text: "I told my therapist I have commitment issues. Turns out I just needed to add a better message."
  explanation: "This plays on the dual meaning of 'commit' in Git versus personal relationships, with the punchline referencing commit messages, creating layered humor that works on psychological and technical levels."
  rating: 9

- text: "A junior dev asks: 'Why is it called a pull request if I'm pushing my code?' Senior dev: 'Welcome to the first of many contradictions.'"
  explanation: "This highlights the genuine confusion many beginners face with Git terminology, using the question-answer format to expose the counterintuitive nature of 'pull request' naming while acknowledging the broader complexities of programming."
  rating: 8

- text: "Git merge: because sometimes you need to blame two people at once."
  explanation: "This subverts the concept of 'git blame' by applying it to merge commits, creating humor through the idea that merged code allows for distributed responsibility (or blame) across multiple developers."
  rating: 7

- text: "My relationship status is like my Git workflow: it's complicated, has too many branches, and I'm afraid to merge anything."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares romantic relationships to Git branching strategies, using the relatable fear of merge conflicts to comment on relationship commitment issues."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer stare at the merge conflict for hours? He was waiting for it to resolve itself."
  explanation: "This plays on both the technical term 'resolve' in version control and the wishful thinking many developers experience when facing difficult merge conflicts, using absurdity to create humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "In version control, unlike life, you can actually revert your mistakes. That's why we're all here."
  explanation: "This joke uses the relief theory of humor, acknowledging that Git's ability to undo changes provides a safety net that life doesn't offer, creating both humor and existential commentary."
  rating: 9

- text: "A developer's last words: 'I'll just force push to main, what could go wrong?'"
  explanation: "This creates humor through dramatic irony, as experienced developers know exactly what could go wrong, while framing it as famous last words before disaster."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why is Git like a time machine? Because you spend most of your time trying to fix the timeline you just broke."
  explanation: "This compares Git's history manipulation to time travel paradoxes, highlighting how attempts to fix version control often create more problems, using science fiction concepts to explain technical frustrations."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Wait, that's not version control—or is it?"
  explanation: "This subverts the famous 'Most Interesting Man' meme while questioning whether production deployment is a form of version control, creating humor through the blurring of best practices and reality."
  rating: 6

- text: "Git status: 'Your branch is ahead by 547 commits.' My confidence: also ahead by 547 delusions."
  explanation: "This creates a parallel structure between Git's branch status and personal overconfidence, suggesting that being far ahead in commits might indicate divergence rather than progress."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer create 50 branches? He couldn't decide which future he wanted to live in, so he kept all the timelines open."
  explanation: "This uses the multiverse concept to explain excessive branching, creating humor through the absurd application of quantum physics to the mundane problem of indecisive development."
  rating: 7

- text: "A commit message that says 'fixed stuff' is just a cry for help in 12 characters or less."
  explanation: "This reframes poor commit messages as emotional distress signals, using misdirection to comment on both the technical problem of uninformative commits and the psychological state of overwhelmed developers."
  rating: 8

- text: "My Git log reads like a psychological thriller: 'Fixed bug,' 'Actually fixed bug,' 'Fixed the fix,' 'Reverted everything,' 'Starting over,' 'Why do I exist?'"
  explanation: "This creates a narrative arc through commit messages that descends from confidence to existential crisis, using the progression to mirror the emotional journey many developers experience during difficult debugging sessions."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't Git users ever feel lonely? Because they're always in a relationship—with upstream, origin, and that fork they made six months ago and forgot about."
  explanation: "This extends the relationship metaphor to include multiple Git remotes, creating humor through the complexity of managing multiple repository relationships and the relatable experience of abandoned forks."
  rating: 8

- text: "A philosopher, a time traveler, and a Git user walk into a bar. They're all the same person, just from different branches of reality, and they're all arguing about which version of themselves should merge first."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines multiple concepts: philosophy, time travel, and Git branching, creating a meta-narrative that treats version control as a metaphor for parallel universes while exploring the absurdity of merge conflicts through an existential lens."
