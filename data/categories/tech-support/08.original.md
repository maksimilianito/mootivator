- text: "Tech support: turning it off and on again since 1975."
  explanation: This joke plays on the most common and stereotypical tech support solution. It's a simple statement that highlights how this basic troubleshooting step has been the go-to fix for decades, using the superiority theory where we all recognize this universal experience.

- text: "Why did the help desk technician bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud."
  explanation: This uses the double meaning pattern, playing on "cloud" as both a physical object in the sky and cloud computing. The misdirection makes the audience expect a technical answer but delivers a literal interpretation.

- text: "Tech support is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you're gonna troubleshoot."
  explanation: A parody of the famous Forrest Gump quote, this joke uses cultural reference humor to highlight the unpredictable nature of tech support work, where each call brings a completely different problem.

- text: "I told the user to press any key. They asked where the 'any' key was."
  explanation: This classic tech support joke uses the incongruity between literal interpretation and intended meaning. It highlights the communication gap between technical and non-technical users through a simple misunderstanding.

- text: "Why don't tech support agents ever get lost? They always follow the script."
  explanation: This joke plays on the double meaning of "script" - both a troubleshooting guide and directions. It gently mocks the sometimes rigid adherence to support protocols while acknowledging it as a navigation tool.

- text: "A user called saying their computer had a virus. It was just a pop-up ad for antivirus software."
  explanation: This uses situational irony where the warning about a problem becomes mistaken for the problem itself. It reflects the common experience of users misidentifying technical issues.

- text: "Tech support: where 'Have you tried restarting?' is both the question and the answer."
  explanation: This self-referential joke highlights the recursive nature of basic troubleshooting, using the paradox pattern to show how one solution applies to almost every problem.

- text: "Why did the tech support agent go to therapy? Too many unresolved tickets."
  explanation: This uses the double meaning of "unresolved" - both technical issues and emotional problems. It applies psychological terminology to technical work, creating humor through the incongruity of mixing domains.

- text: "User: 'My computer won't turn on.' Support: 'Is it plugged in?' User: 'I'm not stupid.' Support: 'So... is it plugged in?' User: 'Hold on...' *click*"
  explanation: This dialogue joke uses the superiority theory and real-world experience. The humor comes from the defensive reaction followed by the implied admission that yes, it wasn't plugged in, a common tech support scenario.

- text: "Help desk tier 1: Google it. Tier 2: Google it better. Tier 3: Read the documentation."
  explanation: This joke uses escalating pattern humor to satirize the support hierarchy. It suggests that different support levels use the same basic approach with varying sophistication, which resonates with both support staff and users.

- text: "Why did the support ticket go to the gym? It wanted to get escalated."
  explanation: This uses the double meaning of "escalated" - both gaining muscle/elevation and being passed to higher support tiers. The personification of a ticket adds to the absurdity.

- text: "Remote support: where you watch someone struggle with their mouse for 45 minutes before realizing they're using a stapler."
  explanation: This absurdist joke exaggerates the challenges of remote support where you can't see the user's setup. The extreme scenario of mistaking a stapler for a mouse creates humor through impossibility that feels somehow plausible.

- text: "Tech support is just professional gaslighting. 'It works fine for me!'"
  explanation: This edgy joke uses the incongruity between the term "gaslighting" and the innocent act of testing software. It captures the frustrating experience where problems disappear when support tries to reproduce them.

- text: "A user called saying their keyboard wasn't working. I asked them to type their name. They did."
  explanation: This short story joke uses logical paradox humor. The user demonstrates the keyboard works while claiming it doesn't, highlighting the common disconnect between perceived and actual problems.

- text: "Why do tech support agents make terrible comedians? Their timing is always 'Please wait 2-3 business days.'"
  explanation: This joke applies comedy principles (timing) to tech support response times. It uses the incongruity between instant comedy delivery and slow support resolution to create humor about a universal frustration.

- text: "Customer: 'Your software deleted my files!' Support: 'Did you save them?' Customer: 'No.' Support: 'Then technically, you deleted them.' Customer: *hangs up*"
  explanation: This dialogue joke uses logical precision to shift blame humorously. The support agent's technically correct but unhelpful response captures the sometimes adversarial nature of support interactions while highlighting user responsibility.

- text: "Tech support drinking game: take a shot every time someone says 'It was working yesterday.' You'll be unconscious by lunch."
  explanation: This joke uses exaggeration and the drinking game format to emphasize how frequently users claim previous functionality. The hyperbolic outcome (unconscious by lunch) underscores the commonality of this phrase.

- text: "Why did the tech support agent quit? They couldn't handle the emotional bandwidth of explaining what bandwidth is."
  explanation: This meta-joke uses the double meaning of "bandwidth" (network capacity and emotional capacity) while creating a recursive loop where explaining technical terms becomes emotionally exhausting, which itself requires explanation.

- text: "Level 1 support: 'Have you tried restarting?' Level 2 support: 'Let me escalate this to someone who will tell you to restart.' Level 3 support: 'Why didn't you restart?'"
  explanation: This three-tier joke creates a circular pattern that satirizes the support hierarchy. Despite escalation through multiple levels, the solution remains the same, highlighting the absurdity of the process while revealing the truth that basic solutions often work.

- text: "User opened a ticket: 'URGENT! EVERYTHING IS BROKEN!' Support response: 'Can you be more specific?' User: 'Yes, it's VERY broken.' Support: 'What specifically isn't working?' User: 'I forgot my password.'"
  explanation: This escalating dialogue joke uses the incongruity between catastrophic language and a trivial problem. It captures the common experience where users' emotional intensity doesn't match the technical severity, creating humor through disproportion.

- text: "Tech support is the only job where 'I don't know, it just started working' is a valid closing statement for a ticket marked 'RESOLVED.'"
  explanation: This joke uses irony to highlight the mysterious nature of technical problems. It captures the relief-theory aspect where both support and users accept inexplicable solutions, acknowledging that sometimes technology fixes itself and that's somehow acceptable professionally, which is absurd in any other context.
