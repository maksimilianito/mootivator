- text: "My CSS is like my love life: everything is !important but nothing aligns."
  explanation: "This joke uses the CSS property '!important' which overrides other styles, creating a parallel with trying too hard in relationships while still failing to achieve harmony (alignment). It's self-deprecating humor about both coding struggles and personal life."

- text: "Why did the HTML element go to therapy? It had too many parent issues."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'parent' - in HTML, elements have parent-child relationships in the DOM tree, while also referencing the common psychological concept of having issues with one's parents."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my website it needed to be more responsive. Now it won't stop asking how I feel."
  explanation: "This exploits the double meaning of 'responsive' - in web development, it means adapting to different screen sizes, but in human interaction, it means being emotionally attentive. The misdirection creates humor through anthropomorphizing the website."
  rating: 9

- text: "Web developers don't die, they just lose their cache."
  explanation: "A play on the phrase 'lose their cache' (pronounced like 'cash') which in web development means temporary storage, but sounds like the expression 'lose their cachet' meaning losing prestige or relevance."

- text: "Why do JavaScript developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: "This is a programming language pun - JavaScript developers can't see sharp (C#, pronounced 'C sharp', is another programming language). It uses visual impairment as a metaphor for not knowing other languages."
  rating: 5

- text: "My website is like a restaurant with no menu - it's all à la carte... and by that I mean everything is broken."
  explanation: "This joke sets up an expectation about fancy dining ('à la carte') but the punchline reveals it's actually about poor website functionality where nothing works properly, using misdirection for comedic effect."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three hours debugging my CSS. Turns out I had a semicolon in the wrong place. In my JavaScript file."
  explanation: "This highlights the frustration of debugging when you're looking in the wrong place entirely. CSS doesn't use semicolons the way JavaScript does, making the error location absurdly off-target."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a web developer's favorite tea? Certain-tea. What they actually get? Uncertain-tea with a side of anxiety."
  explanation: "This plays on 'certainty' vs 'uncertainty' - web developers want predictable results but often face unpredictable browser behaviors, compatibility issues, and deployment problems."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code is perfectly semantic HTML5. Unfortunately, the semantics are 'chaos,' 'desperation,' and 'why.'"
  explanation: "Semantic HTML means using tags that convey meaning about content structure. This joke pretends the actual semantic meaning is the developer's emotional state rather than proper document structure."
  rating: 8

- text: "I made my website accessible. Now everyone can see how bad it is."
  explanation: "This is self-deprecating humor about web accessibility (making sites usable for people with disabilities). The ironic twist is that making something more accessible also makes its flaws more visible."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the web developer leave the restaurant? Because of the table layout."
  explanation: "This references the outdated practice of using HTML tables for page layout (rather than CSS), which is now considered bad practice. The joke works on both literal and technical levels."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my JavaScript, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A play on the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme format, highlighting the dangerous (but sometimes real) practice of testing code on live websites rather than in development environments."
  rating: 7

- text: "My website loads in three seconds. Unfortunately, that's per element."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity - three seconds sounds reasonable for a full page load, but becomes absurdly slow when it's per element, suggesting thousands of seconds total load time."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between HTML and HTML5? About five years of arguing in meetings."
  explanation: "This satirizes the slow adoption of new web standards and the endless debates about when and how to implement them in organizations, suggesting bureaucracy moves slower than technology."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally achieved pixel-perfect design. Then someone opened it on their phone."
  explanation: "This captures the frustration of responsive design - creating something perfect on one screen size only to have it break on the countless other devices and screen sizes that exist."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do front-end developers eat lunch alone? They can't stop talking about frameworks, and everyone else can't stop leaving."
  explanation: "This gently mocks the tendency of developers to obsess over JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and debate their merits endlessly, boring non-technical people."
  rating: 6

- text: "I wrote a website that works perfectly in every browser. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "This uses the 'it was all a dream' trope to emphasize the impossibility of achieving perfect cross-browser compatibility, one of web development's most persistent frustrations."
  rating: 7

- text: "My CSS has more specificity than my career goals. And it's just as likely to conflict with itself."
  explanation: "CSS specificity determines which styles get applied when multiple rules target the same element. This compares it to having overly specific but contradictory life plans, using technical concepts as metaphor for personal confusion."
  rating: 8

- text: "What did the JavaScript developer say after breaking up? 'It's not undefined, it's just null.' His ex replied: 'No, we're definitely undefined now.'"
  explanation: "This exploits the technical difference between 'null' (intentionally empty) and 'undefined' (doesn't exist) in JavaScript to create a dialogue about relationship status, where both parties interpret the breakup differently using programming terminology."
  rating: 9

- text: "I'm not saying my website is slow, but I submitted the form and got a response by postal mail first."
  explanation: "This uses extreme exaggeration to mock slow website performance, suggesting the site is so slow that physical mail (notoriously slow) is actually faster, creating absurdist humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "A web developer walks into a bar, a restaurant, a coffee shop, and a library. He was trying to find the right viewport, but everywhere he went, his content just kept overflowing."
  explanation: "This is a sophisticated multi-layered joke: the setup mimics the classic 'walks into a bar' format but subverts it by having him walk into multiple places. The punchline uses CSS terminology (viewport and overflow) to describe both his physical wandering and a common CSS layout problem, creating a perfect parallel between the literal and technical meanings."
