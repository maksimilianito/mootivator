- text: "My code compiled on the first try. Now I'm scared to run it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the programmer's expectation that code rarely compiles without errors. The incongruity comes from treating success as suspicious rather than celebratory, highlighting the common experience of hidden bugs that only reveal themselves at runtime."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do bugs always appear in production? Because they're shy and only come out when it matters most."
  explanation: "This personifies software bugs with human characteristics (shyness), creating humor through the absurd suggestion that bugs have intentionality. It also reflects the frustrating reality that testing environments often fail to catch issues that emerge in production."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't have bugs in my code. I have undocumented features with unpredictable behavior."
  explanation: "This uses the classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' defense mechanism, adding an extra layer by acknowledging the 'unpredictable behavior' which undermines the defense itself. The self-aware contradiction creates the humor."

- text: "A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd. First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames."
  explanation: "This story-format joke illustrates the difference between testing edge cases and real-world usage. The escalating absurdity of test cases contrasts sharply with the simple, untested real-world scenario that causes catastrophic failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on the double meaning of 'cache' (computer memory) and 'cash' (money). The wordplay creates humor through the unexpected application of a technical term to a financial situation."
  rating: 5

- text: "My code doesn't always work, but when it doesn't, I blame the compiler."
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme structure while highlighting the common programmer tendency to externalize blame. The humor comes from the recognition of this defensive behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "There are two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that demonstrates an off-by-one error while listing it as a problem. The self-referential nature creates multiple layers of humor, and the list itself is a famous programming aphorism."
  rating: 10

- text: "How do you know your code has a bug? Don't worry, your users will tell you. Repeatedly. At 3 AM."
  explanation: "This captures the anxiety of production bugs and the reality that users often discover issues before monitoring systems do. The time specificity adds to the relatability for developers who've experienced emergency fixes."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally found the bug! It was between the chair and the keyboard."
  explanation: "This uses the classic PEBCAK (Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard) concept, suggesting user error. The misdirection works because the reader expects a technical bug, not a human one."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why don't bugs ever take vacations? Because they're always working in production."
  explanation: "This personifies bugs while highlighting the frustrating reality that bugs seem to preferentially appear in production environments rather than during development or testing phases."
  rating: 6

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks, 'Could you go to the store and get a gallon of milk, and if they have eggs, get a dozen?' The programmer returns with 12 gallons of milk and says, 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "This joke illustrates how literal interpretation of conditional logic can lead to absurd results. It plays on the difference between human contextual understanding and programmatic logic."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it's probably bad."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that applies the principle of joke-telling to code quality. The self-referential nature creates irony, as explaining this joke doesn't make it bad—it makes it clever."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the bug hide in the comments? Because nobody ever reads those anyway."
  explanation: "This plays on the common practice of inadequate code documentation and the tendency to ignore comments during debugging. The personification of the bug adds an element of playful absurdity."
  rating: 6

- text: "I wrote a program to find bugs in my code. Now I have two problems: the original bugs and the bugs in my bug-finder."
  explanation: "This applies the famous regex joke structure ('Now you have two problems') to debugging tools, highlighting the recursive nature of software complexity and the irony of debugging tools containing bugs themselves."
  rating: 7

- text: "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer, the victim, and the confused bystander who can't remember anything."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor captures the multiple roles developers play when debugging their own code. The absurdity of being all parties involved creates humor while accurately depicting the debugging experience."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because bugs are attracted to the light, and we're trying to hide."
  explanation: "This takes the common 'light attracts bugs' pun and extends it with a strategic implication—that developers use dark mode as camouflage. The layered logic creates a more sophisticated joke structure."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "Using the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format, this joke ironically presents a terrible practice as if it were sophisticated. The humor comes from the recognition that this sometimes happens unintentionally."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables, and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This personifies a SQL query and uses the double meaning of 'join' (social and database operation). The setup-punchline structure works well with the technical wordplay."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the developer refuse to fix the bug? He said it had been there so long it was now a legacy feature, and removing it might break backward compatibility with the chaos."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes technical debt and the fear of fixing long-standing issues. The phrase 'backward compatibility with the chaos' elevates the humor by treating dysfunction as something to preserve."
  rating: 8

- text: "I spent all day debugging, and finally found the issue. It was a semicolon. A semicolon that I added while debugging."
  explanation: "This captures the frustrating irony of creating bugs while trying to fix them. The specificity of the semicolon makes it relatable to many programmers' experiences, and the circular nature creates the comedic twist."
  rating: 8

- text: "The best thing about a boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by one bit. The worst thing about a bug is even if you're close, you're infinitely far from working."
  explanation: "This philosophical joke contrasts the precision of boolean values with the binary nature of software functionality (it either works or it doesn't). The parallel structure and unexpected depth create sophisticated humor that rewards technical understanding."
