- text: "The first programmer was a woman, but she still couldn't get the machine to listen."
  explanation: "A play on Ada Lovelace being the first programmer and the stereotype about listening, combined with the reality that early mechanical computers were notoriously difficult to operate."

- text: "Why did the ENIAC go to therapy? It had 18,000 vacuum tube issues."
  explanation: "The ENIAC literally had 18,000 vacuum tubes that frequently failed, creating a double meaning between technical problems and personal 'issues' requiring therapy."

- text: "Grace Hopper found the first computer bug. The computer has been making excuses ever since."
  explanation: "References the famous moth incident while playing on how we've been blaming 'bugs' for computer problems ever since that literal bug was found."

- text: "Punch cards: because 'Ctrl+Z' wasn't invented yet, and neither was mercy."
  explanation: "Highlights the unforgiving nature of punch card programming where a single misplaced hole meant starting over completely, contrasting with modern undo functions."

- text: "In the 1960s, they said computers would never fit in a home. They were right—the air conditioning unit wouldn't fit either."
  explanation: "Early computers like the IBM mainframes required massive cooling systems, making the prediction technically correct for the wrong reasons."

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to use COBOL? He didn't want to MOVE his career BACKWARD."
  explanation: "Uses COBOL's verbose syntax (MOVE command) while playing on career progression and the language being considered outdated."

- text: "The Y2K bug taught us two things: panic sells, and sometimes the real bug is human overreaction."
  explanation: "References the massive Y2K preparation efforts and subsequent anticlimactic transition, questioning whether the response was proportional to the actual threat."

- text: "Alan Turing broke the Enigma code. Modern developers break production on Fridays. We've evolved."
  explanation: "Contrasts one of computing's greatest achievements with the common developer practice of avoiding deployments before weekends, using ironic 'evolution.'"

- text: "Why don't historians use punch cards anymore? Because even they couldn't debug the past."
  explanation: "Plays on the difficulty of fixing punch card errors and the impossibility of changing history, with 'debugging the past' as a double meaning."

- text: "The first computer mouse was made of wood. It still had better click rates than most modern ads."
  explanation: "References Douglas Engelbart's wooden mouse prototype while making a contemporary joke about online advertising metrics."

- text: "In 1981, Bill Gates said 640KB ought to be enough for anybody. He was right—enough to never live it down."
  explanation: "The famous misattributed quote becomes a joke about how this statement has haunted Gates, with 'enough' taking on a different meaning."

- text: "Why did the IBM PC succeed? Because it came with a manual that admitted computers were complicated. Honesty was revolutionary."
  explanation: "Contrasts with modern 'intuitive' design philosophy by suggesting that acknowledging complexity was actually refreshing and helpful."

- text: "Steve Jobs put computers in a beige box and called it revolutionary. Then he put them in a white box and actually was."
  explanation: "References the evolution from the Apple II to the iMac, showing how the same person redefined what revolutionary meant in computing design."

- text: "The Xerox PARC engineers invented the GUI, the mouse, and Ethernet. Xerox invented how to miss opportunities. Both were groundbreaking."
  explanation: "Highlights one of tech history's greatest ironies—Xerox's research center created revolutionary technologies that other companies profited from."

- text: "Why was the Commodore 64 so popular? Because it could run 64 colors and 64 reasons to convince your parents it was educational."
  explanation: "Plays on the C64's technical specs while referencing the common childhood experience of justifying game computers as learning tools."

- text: "The first computer virus was created in 1983 as an experiment. The first antivirus was created in 1984 as a business model. Evolution is beautiful."
  explanation: "Cynically traces how the virus/antivirus cycle began, suggesting the solution industry emerged suspiciously quickly after the problem."

- text: "Why did Unix use forward slashes while DOS used backslashes? Because even in the 1970s, developers couldn't agree on directions. We call this 'standards.'"
  explanation: "Highlights the arbitrary nature of technical decisions that become entrenched, creating lasting incompatibilities from simple choices."

- text: "Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and gave it away for free. Today's developers can't even give away their open-source projects without a monetization strategy. He didn't invent the web—he invented making VCs cry."
  explanation: "Contrasts the altruistic creation of the web with modern startup culture, suggesting the real innovation was creating something valuable without immediate profit motive."

- text: "The Apollo Guidance Computer had 64KB of memory and landed humans on the moon. My smart fridge has 2GB and can't even tell when milk is expired. We've clearly optimized for the wrong metrics."
  explanation: "Sharply contrasts the incredible achievement of space travel with minimal computing power against modern devices with vastly more power doing trivial tasks poorly."

- text: "Why do computer historians drink? Because every time they explain that Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm in 1843, someone asks 'But could she code in JavaScript?' The past is a foreign country, and some people need a passport."
  explanation: "Addresses the anachronistic thinking that judges historical figures by modern standards, while celebrating Lovelace's genuine pioneering achievement."

- text: "The ARPANET's first message was 'LO' because it crashed before sending 'LOGIN.' Sixty years later, we're still crashing before finishing what we started. Some traditions are worth keeping."
  explanation: "References the famous first network message failure as a metaphor for the entire history of computing—ambitious goals, incomplete execution, and calling it progress anyway."
