- text: "I read the GPL license agreement. All of it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the fact that software licenses, especially open-source ones like GPL, are notoriously long and dense legal documents that almost nobody actually reads completely. The humor comes from the absurdity of someone claiming to have done this Herculean task, presented as a simple statement that sounds almost like a confession or boast."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't developers read license agreements? They're already used to accepting terms and conditions without reading them."
  explanation: "This is a self-aware joke that uses the superiority theory, gently mocking the common practice of clicking 'I agree' without reading. It creates humor through the recognition of a universal bad habit in the tech community."
  rating: 5

- text: "My code is so open source, even I don't know what license it's under."
  explanation: "This joke uses self-deprecating humor about the confusion surrounding open-source licensing. It plays on the incongruity between being 'open' and being disorganized or unknowledgeable about one's own project."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between proprietary software and a black box? The black box has better documentation."
  explanation: "This uses comparison humor to highlight the common frustration with closed-source software having poor or inaccessible documentation. The punchline creates an unexpected comparison that rings true for many developers."
  rating: 9

- text: "I tried to fork a proprietary repository. My lawyer called."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'fork' in programming (copying a repository) and the legal impossibility of doing so with proprietary software. The brevity and unexpected escalation to legal consequences creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer choose MIT license? Because he couldn't afford a lawyer to explain Apache 2.0."
  explanation: "This references the real complexity differences between various open-source licenses. MIT is famously short and simple, while Apache 2.0 is more comprehensive and complex. The humor comes from the relatable truth about license complexity."
  rating: 7

- text: "My startup's business model: take GPL code, rebrand it, hope nobody notices. My lawyer's business model: defend me when they do."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through the absurdity of openly admitting to a license violation strategy. It uses misdirection by presenting a terrible business plan as if it were legitimate, then adding the lawyer as a punchline that acknowledges the inevitable consequences."
  rating: 9

- text: "Open source means everyone can see your code. Closed source means everyone can see your bugs anyway."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses incongruity to suggest that hiding code doesn't hide problems. It's a philosophical observation wrapped in humor, playing on the debate between open and closed source philosophies."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do companies love dual licensing? They get to have their cake and sue it too."
  explanation: "This wordplay on 'have your cake and eat it too' references the practice where companies offer software under both open-source and commercial licenses, allowing them to benefit from community contributions while still monetizing their product and protecting it legally."
  rating: 9

- text: "I released my code under the 'Good Luck With That' license. It's very permissive."
  explanation: "This creates a fictional humorous license that captures the attitude of developers who release code without support or guarantees. It plays on the various real permissive licenses while adding an element of developer cynicism."
  rating: 8

- text: "What do you call software with 47 dependencies, each under different licenses? A lawyer's retirement plan."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the very real problem of license compatibility in modern software development, where dependency trees can create complex legal situations. The punchline about lawyers retiring on the complexity is an exaggeration that resonates with developers' frustrations."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the developer switch from GPL to MIT? He wanted his code to have commitment issues too."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes code licenses, with GPL being more 'committed' (copyleft) and MIT being more 'casual' (permissive). The humor comes from applying relationship terminology to licensing philosophy."
  rating: 7

- text: "I contribute to open source for the community. And because proprietary software rejected my pull request."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection humor, starting with a noble reason and then revealing a more mundane, self-deprecating truth. It plays on the joke that you can't even submit pull requests to closed-source software."
  rating: 6

- text: "The EULA was longer than the software's codebase. I should have known it was malware."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through the incongruity of a license agreement being longer than the actual program, which is often a red flag. It's a commentary on how suspicious software often hides behind verbose legal text."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers hate software patents? Because they already have enough bugs to deal with without legal ones."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'bugs' to connect programming problems with legal problems. It's a play on how patents can create legal complications (bugs) in addition to technical ones, using the relief theory to express frustration."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code is licensed under Creative Commons BY-NC-ND. By that I mean: Broken, Yelling at Compiler, No Clue, Not Done."
  explanation: "This takes a real Creative Commons license acronym and reinterprets it to describe the state of someone's code. The humor comes from the creative reinterpretation and the honest self-assessment of code quality."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the most popular license on GitHub? 'No License File Found' â€“ because nothing says open source like legal ambiguity."
  explanation: "This joke points out the ironic reality that many repositories lack explicit licenses, creating legal uncertainty. The sarcastic punchline highlights how this defeats the purpose of open source clarity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the company's legal team love the developer's side project? It violated three different licenses simultaneously. They'd never seen such efficiency."
  explanation: "This uses absurdist humor where the legal team 'appreciates' violations as if they were achievements. The word 'efficiency' applied to license violations creates a darkly comic incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a license that requires users to star the repo before using the code. My lawyer said that's not how any of this works. My GitHub stars say otherwise."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the idea of creating ridiculous license requirements and the conflict between legal validity and practical results. The structure builds through three beats: the absurd idea, the legal reality, and the pragmatic outcome."
  rating: 8

- text: "Open source is free like a puppy is free. Sure, no upfront cost, but wait until you see the license compliance bills."
  explanation: "This uses the classic 'free like a puppy' analogy and applies it to open source software, highlighting the hidden costs of license management and compliance. It's a sophisticated joke that works on multiple levels for those familiar with both sayings and enterprise software management."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer read every word of the license agreement before installing the software? He didn't. This is a joke, not science fiction."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses misdirection by setting up an expectation in the question, then completely subverting it in the answer. It's self-aware humor that acknowledges its own absurdist premise while commenting on universal behavior. The 'science fiction' comparison elevates the absurdity to its peak."
