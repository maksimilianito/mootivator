- text: "The best documentation is the code itself, said the developer who was fired next week."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common but misguided belief that self-documenting code eliminates the need for actual documentation. The punchline reveals the consequence of this attitude through the developer's termination, highlighting that while code may be clear to the writer, it's rarely sufficient for others or for future maintenance."

- text: "Why did the API documentation go to therapy? It had too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "This uses a double meaning of 'issues' - both the technical GitHub/tracking issues that plague poorly documented APIs, and the psychological issues that require therapy. The personification of documentation creates the incongruity that drives the humor."

- text: "Documentation is like sex: when it's good, it's very good, and when it's bad, it's still better than nothing."
  explanation: "This aphorism adapts a classic saying to the programming context, creating humor through the unexpected comparison while making a valid point about the value of even imperfect documentation. The incongruity between the intimate subject and technical documentation creates the comedic effect."

- text: "I would document my code, but then I'd have two things to maintain."
  explanation: "This joke captures the self-defeating logic many developers use to avoid writing documentation. The humor comes from the honest admission of laziness disguised as practical reasoning, revealing the real reason documentation doesn't get written."

- text: "Why don't developers write documentation? Because they're too busy answering the same questions on Slack."
  explanation: "The irony here is that developers spend more time repeatedly answering questions than they would if they'd just written documentation once. This highlights the false economy of avoiding documentation through the incongruity of the extra work it creates."

- text: "Our documentation is so good, it's only three versions behind the actual code."
  explanation: "This joke uses ironic praise to highlight the common problem of documentation drift. The humor comes from calling outdated documentation 'good' and the specific detail of being 'three versions behind' making the situation concrete and relatable."

- text: "What's the difference between documentation and fiction? Fiction has to make sense."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses the superiority theory, suggesting that documentation is often so poorly written or outdated that it's less coherent than fiction. The unexpected twist is that fiction, which is made up, has higher standards for logical consistency."

- text: "I finally finished documenting my code. Now I just need to update it for all the changes I made while documenting."
  explanation: "This captures the recursive problem of documentation: the code evolves even during the documentation process. The humor comes from the absurdist situation where documentation itself causes the need for more documentation, creating an infinite loop."

- text: "README.md: where 'read me' is more of a suggestion than a command."
  explanation: "This plays on the imperative nature of the filename versus the reality that most people skip reading documentation. The joke highlights the gap between intention and behavior through the reframing of a command as a mere suggestion."

- text: "Why was the documentation always invited to parties? Because it was so entertaining... said no one ever."
  explanation: "This anti-joke builds up an expectation with the setup, then subverts it with the 'said no one ever' punchline. It acknowledges the boring reputation of documentation while using the format of a typical joke structure."

- text: "My code is self-documenting. Unfortunately, it's written in a language only I can understand: desperation and caffeine."
  explanation: "This joke mocks the 'self-documenting code' excuse while adding a layer of self-deprecating humor about the actual quality of hastily written code. The personalized 'language' of desperation and caffeine resonates with developer experiences."

- text: "Documentation: because 'git blame' doesn't explain WHY you did it, only WHO to blame."
  explanation: "This joke references the git blame command while highlighting the difference between tracking code changes and understanding the reasoning behind them. The wordplay on 'blame' emphasizes that documentation provides context that version control cannot."

- text: "Why did the developer write a 500-page manual for a two-line script? He was paid by the word."
  explanation: "This exaggerated scenario pokes fun at over-documentation and misaligned incentives. The absurdity of the ratio (500 pages for two lines) creates the humor while commenting on how documentation requirements can become divorced from actual need."

- text: "The code worked perfectly until I tried to explain it in the documentation. Then I realized it didn't work at all."
  explanation: "This joke captures the valuable side effect of documentation: the rubber duck debugging phenomenon where explaining code reveals its flaws. The humor comes from the reversal where documentation, meant to explain working code, reveals that it never worked."

- text: "How do you know a developer wrote the documentation? Chapter 1: 'It works on my machine.'"
  explanation: "This references the infamous developer excuse while suggesting it would appear in official documentation. The incongruity of putting such an unhelpful statement in formal documentation creates the humor."

- text: "I don't always write documentation, but when I do, I make sure to use words like 'obviously,' 'simply,' and 'just' to make everyone feel inadequate."
  explanation: "This self-aware joke highlights the condescending language that often appears in technical documentation. The humor comes from the honest admission that these words, meant to simplify, actually alienate readers by implying the material is easier than it is."

- text: "Why was the API documentation arrested? For making false promises and breaking contracts."
  explanation: "This personification joke uses legal terminology that doubles as programming concepts (contracts, promises). The humor works on multiple levels: documentation that doesn't match implementation, and the programming concepts of promises and interface contracts."

- text: "Our documentation follows the DRY principle: Don't Rely on it, Yell at the developer instead."
  explanation: "This cleverly subverts the famous 'Don't Repeat Yourself' programming principle with a cynical alternative meaning. The joke acknowledges the reality that poor documentation forces people to directly contact developers, defeating the purpose of having documentation."

- text: "I spent six months writing comprehensive documentation. The project was cancelled the next day. The documentation lives on as a monument to futility, perfectly formatted and completely useless."
  explanation: "This dark humor story captures the tragedy of wasted effort in software development. The specific details (six months, cancelled next day) and the poetic description of the documentation as a 'monument to futility' create both humor and pathos."

- text: "Why did the documentation win an award for fiction? Because it described features that would be 'coming soon' for five years."
  explanation: "This joke combines the documentation-as-fiction theme with the common problem of vaporware and eternally delayed features. The specific timeframe (five years) makes the absurdity concrete while the fiction award provides a clever framing device."

- text: "A developer writes documentation so clear and comprehensive that future developers understand the code immediately. He wakes up. It was just a dream. He checks the repo. The only documentation is a comment that says '// good luck lol'."
  explanation: "This extended joke uses the dream-sequence structure to build up an ideal scenario before crashing back to reality. The final comment '// good luck lol' is both relatable and darkly funny, representing the opposite extreme of good documentation. The story format allows for emotional investment before the punchline, making it more impactful."
