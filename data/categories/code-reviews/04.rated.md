- text: "Code reviews: where your semicolons get more attention than your logic."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common experience in code reviews where reviewers often focus on minor formatting issues like semicolons rather than examining the actual algorithmic logic or design decisions. It's a gentle jab at the sometimes misplaced priorities in peer review."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer's code review take so long? Because every comment spawned three more threads."
  explanation: "This uses the familiar pattern of endless discussion threads that can emerge from a single code review comment, where each response leads to more debate. It references the frustration of reviews that never seem to reach resolution."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code review feedback: 'Looks good to me, but have you considered rewriting the entire thing?'"
  explanation: "This captures the contradiction often found in code reviews where someone approves the code but then suggests massive changes. It highlights the inconsistency between the approval and the actual feedback given."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code reviews are like family dinners—everyone has an opinion about how you should've done it differently."
  explanation: "This analogy compares code reviews to family gatherings where unsolicited advice flows freely. It uses a relatable non-technical scenario to illustrate the sometimes overwhelming nature of receiving multiple perspectives on your work."
  rating: 7

- text: "I submitted my code for review three days ago. I've aged considerably since then."
  explanation: "This joke exaggerates the often lengthy wait time for code review feedback, playing on the feeling that time moves slowly when you're blocked waiting for approval. The hyperbole makes the common frustration humorous."
  rating: 5

- text: "What's the difference between a code review and a therapy session? In therapy, they don't suggest you refactor your childhood."
  explanation: "This comparison humorously suggests that code reviews can feel deeply personal and invasive, like therapy, but goes further by imagining reviewers wanting to 'refactor' your past—a play on the technical term applied to life."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code reviewer said 'This could be more elegant.' I didn't know we were writing poetry."
  explanation: "This highlights the subjective nature of code review feedback, particularly around aesthetic concerns like 'elegance.' It questions whether code review is about functionality or artistry, using the poetry comparison to emphasize the absurdity."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do developers fear code reviews? Because 'constructive criticism' is just 'criticism' with extra steps."
  explanation: "This plays on the phrase 'constructive criticism' often used to soften code review feedback, suggesting that regardless of how it's framed, criticism still feels like criticism. It references the Rick and Morty meme format for added humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Code review status: 47 comments, 3 approvals, 1 existential crisis."
  explanation: "This joke captures the emotional toll of receiving extensive feedback during code reviews. The escalation from technical comments to existential crisis humorously exaggerates how overwhelming the process can feel."
  rating: 9

- text: "In code reviews, 'interesting approach' means 'what were you thinking?'"
  explanation: "This reveals the hidden meaning behind polite code review language. It's a form of translator humor that exposes the diplomatic phrasing reviewers use to mask their actual bewilderment or disapproval."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the code review take six hours? They spent five hours and fifty-five minutes debating tabs versus spaces."
  explanation: "This references the infamous and often pointless debate about code formatting preferences. The extreme time allocation shows how reviews can get derailed by trivial matters while the actual code receives minimal attention."
  rating: 7

- text: "My reviewer wrote 'nit:' before every comment. Turns out my code was one big nit."
  explanation: "The term 'nit' (short for nitpick) is commonly used in code reviews to indicate minor issues. The joke suggests that when every comment is labeled a 'nit,' perhaps the problems aren't so minor after all."
  rating: 6

- text: "Code review feedback came back: 'Please add comments.' I added 'Please approve this PR.' They were not amused."
  explanation: "This is a playful misinterpretation of the request to add code comments, where the developer instead adds a comment pleading for approval. It's a form of malicious compliance humor that shows frustration with the review process."
  rating: 7

- text: "What do you call a code review with no comments? A hallucination."
  explanation: "This joke suggests that code reviews without feedback are so rare they must be imaginary. It plays on the expectation that reviewers will always find something to comment on, making a clean review seem impossible."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code passed review! Turns out the reviewer just approved everything without looking. I don't know whether to celebrate or panic."
  explanation: "This captures the mixed feelings when code is approved too easily—relief at passing review versus concern that it wasn't actually reviewed. It highlights the problem of rubber-stamp approvals that defeat the purpose of peer review."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why are code reviews like horror movies? You never know when someone will jump out and say 'This should be a separate function.'"
  explanation: "This comparison uses the jump-scare element of horror films to describe the sudden, unexpected suggestions that can appear in code reviews. The specific example of function extraction is a common and often surprising piece of feedback."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote 10 lines of code. Got 50 lines of review comments. My code is now 200 lines. Progress!"
  explanation: "This illustrates the ironic outcome where addressing review feedback makes code more complex rather than simpler. The escalating numbers create absurdity, and calling it 'progress' adds sarcasm about whether the changes actually improved anything."
  rating: 9

- text: "Code review drinking game: Take a shot every time someone says 'Why not use a design pattern here?' You'll be unconscious before the second file."
  explanation: "This joke format (drinking game) is applied to the common experience of reviewers suggesting design patterns. The exaggeration that you'd be unconscious quickly emphasizes how frequently this feedback appears, often unnecessarily."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code reviewer and I are in a committed relationship. We disagree about everything, but we're stuck together until this PR merges."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor compares the code review process to a relationship, highlighting the prolonged engagement and inevitable conflicts. The 'stuck together' element captures the binding nature of the review process."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the code reviewer's favorite philosophical question? 'But have you considered doing it completely differently?'"
  explanation: "This frames the common review experience of receiving fundamental architectural suggestions as a philosophical inquiry. It's funny because it presents the reviewer's question as deep and thoughtful when it's actually just frustrating and unhelpful at a late stage."
  rating: 7

- text: "Senior developer's code review: Two words—'Ship it.' Junior developer's code review: Two thousand words—'Let me tell you about every design pattern I learned last week and why your variable names offend me personally.'"
  explanation: "This contrasts the brevity of experienced reviewers with the verbosity of junior reviewers who are eager to demonstrate their knowledge. The escalation from technical critique to personal offense adds absurdity, and it captures the reality that less experienced reviewers often over-comment to prove their expertise."
