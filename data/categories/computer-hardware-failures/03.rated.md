- text: "My hard drive crashed. Now it's just a hard sit."
  explanation: "A simple play on words where 'drive' is removed from the equation when the hardware fails, reducing it to just sitting there - inactive and useless. The humor comes from the literal interpretation of the word 'drive' as movement."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the RAM go to therapy? It couldn't handle the pressure."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'pressure' - both the physical concept of RAM chips being pressured by heat and workload, and the emotional concept of psychological pressure. The anthropomorphization of RAM adds to the absurdity."
  rating: 5

- text: "My computer's fan died. The funeral was overheated."
  explanation: "The incongruity here is that without a working fan, the computer overheats - so even the metaphorical funeral for the fan would be hot. It's a circular reference to the problem the fan's death created."
  rating: 7

- text: "The motherboard had triplets: three beep codes."
  explanation: "This plays on the POST (Power-On Self-Test) beep codes that motherboards emit when hardware fails. The joke anthropomorphizes the motherboard as 'giving birth' to error codes, treating diagnostic beeps as offspring."
  rating: 8

- text: "My SSD failed silently. At least the HDD had the courtesy to click goodbye."
  explanation: "This contrasts the failure modes of different storage technologies - SSDs fail without warning (silently), while traditional HDDs make the infamous 'click of death' sound. The humor lies in treating the clicking sound as a polite farewell."

- text: "Why don't graphics cards ever retire? They keep burning out before they can."
  explanation: "This joke references the common problem of GPUs overheating and failing prematurely, especially during intensive tasks like gaming or crypto mining. The dark humor suggests they never live long enough to have a normal retirement."

- text: "I asked my computer if it was okay. It gave me the blue screen of death. I think that's a no."
  explanation: "The BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) is Windows' most infamous error screen. The humor comes from treating this catastrophic system failure as a simple negative response to a wellness check, understating the severity."
  rating: 6

- text: "My power supply was rated for 500W. Turns out it identified as 200W."
  explanation: "This joke plays on cheap power supplies that falsely advertise their wattage capacity. The modern language of 'identified as' adds a contemporary twist to the classic problem of hardware lying about its specifications."
  rating: 7

- text: "The capacitor on my motherboard bulged. I told it to stop being so dramatic, but it exploded anyway."
  explanation: "Bulging and exploding capacitors are a real hardware failure mode. The humor comes from anthropomorphizing the capacitor as being overly dramatic, when in reality it's following predictable failure physics."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the CPU break up with the cooler? It said their relationship was too thermal."
  explanation: "This uses 'thermal' as a pun - both referring to heat management in computers and playing on 'too formal' or problematic. The relationship metaphor between CPU and cooling system adds another layer."
  rating: 5

- text: "My RAID array failed. Turns out it was a raid BY the drives, not OF the drives."
  explanation: "RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is meant to protect data, but this joke flips the concept - suggesting the drives themselves staged a rebellion. It plays on the word 'raid' as an attack."
  rating: 8

- text: "I tried to revive my dead hard drive with percussive maintenance. Now it's dead AND has a dent."
  explanation: "Percussive maintenance is the half-joking term for hitting malfunctioning electronics. The humor lies in the escalation - not only did it not work, but it made things visibly worse."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do hardware engineers hate optimists? Because they've seen what happens when you assume the magic smoke stays inside."
  explanation: "The 'magic smoke' is a running joke in electronics - components work until you let the smoke out. This joke contrasts optimistic assumptions with the harsh reality of component failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "My network card achieved enlightenment. It disconnected from everything."
  explanation: "This uses spiritual/philosophical language to describe a hardware failure. The joke is that complete disconnection - a catastrophic network failure - is reframed as achieving Buddhist-like detachment from worldly connections."
  rating: 9

- text: "The BIOS couldn't find the boot device. I told it to look harder. It gave me an error message. I think we're in a relationship."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the interaction between user and failing hardware as a dysfunctional relationship, where communication breaks down and neither party understands the other. The escalation to 'relationship' is absurd."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the memory module go to the doctor? It had bad sectors. The doctor said, 'That's a hard drive problem.' The memory said, 'Don't gaslight me.'"
  explanation: "This joke involves mistaken diagnosis (confusing RAM with storage), then uses the contemporary term 'gaslight' to suggest the memory is being told its real problems don't exist - a meta-commentary on misdiagnosis."
  rating: 8

- text: "My computer started smoking. I asked if it picked up the habit from stress. It said, 'No, from the power supply.' Then it died. I should have seen the signs."
  explanation: "This extended narrative treats component failure as a health crisis, with the smoking being both literal (electrical fire) and metaphorical (cigarettes). The regret at the end adds dark humor about preventable failure."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my failing hard drive that data recovery costs $2000. It immediately recovered out of spite. Then corrupted everything. Revenge is a dish served cold, and so is data loss."
  explanation: "This personifies the hard drive as vindictive and petty, first seeming to work then deliberately failing worse. The modified idiom at the end ties the revenge theme to the cold, uncaring nature of hardware failure."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't dead pixels ever come back? Because they've seen the light. And then they stopped seeing anything. Forever. It's actually quite dark."
  explanation: "This joke starts with a spiritual metaphor about 'seeing the light,' then subverts it by taking it literally - the pixel saw light, then died and sees nothing. The final line acknowledges the darkness both literally and metaphorically."
  rating: 7

- text: "My computer won't POST. I tried talking to it, negotiating, pleading. Then I remembered - it's hardware, not my ex. But honestly, they have similar communication styles."
  explanation: "This extended comparison between dealing with failed hardware and a failed relationship creates humor through the unexpected parallel. Both refuse to communicate, ignore your pleas, and leave you confused about what went wrong."

- text: "A server's CPU, RAM, and hard drive walk into a data center. The CPU says, 'I'm overheating.' The RAM says, 'I'm corrupted.' The hard drive says, 'I'm clicking.' The sysadmin says, 'You're all being replaced.' The power supply, who's been quietly dying in the corner, says, 'Not if I have anything to say about it,' and takes them all down. That's cascade failure, folks."
  explanation: "This elaborate setup uses the 'walk into a bar' format but subverts it with realistic hardware failure scenarios. The punchline involves the often-overlooked power supply causing a cascade failure that takes down all components simultaneously - a nightmare scenario delivered as a dark comedy ensemble piece where the quiet character gets the last word."
