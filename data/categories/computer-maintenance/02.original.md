- text: "I updated the server at 3 AM to avoid downtime. The server appreciated the gesture and immediately crashed."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory - the expectation that careful timing would prevent problems is immediately contradicted by the opposite outcome, highlighting the unpredictable nature of system maintenance."

- text: "Why did the sysadmin bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud infrastructure."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke exploiting the double meaning of 'cloud' - both the meteorological phenomenon requiring height and the abstract computing concept."

- text: "Our backup strategy is foolproof. We have backups of our backups. Unfortunately, they all failed simultaneously."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection - setting up confidence in redundancy before revealing the shared point of failure, a common maintenance nightmare."

- text: "How many maintenance windows does it take to fix a critical bug? One more than you scheduled."
  explanation: "A twist on the classic 'how many' joke format, exploiting the universal truth that maintenance always takes longer than planned."

- text: "Our uptime is 99.9%. The other 0.1% is when I'm actually trying to fix things."
  explanation: "Paradoxical humor where the act of maintenance causes the only downtime, highlighting the ironic nature of system care."

- text: "I implemented automated maintenance scripts. Now instead of manually breaking things at 2 AM, the script does it for me at 2 AM."
  explanation: "This joke subverts expectations about automation improving reliability, using incongruity between intended and actual outcomes."

- text: "Why did the database administrator sleep well at night? Because he backed up his dreams too."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor taking the maintenance mindset to illogical extremes, anthropomorphizing the obsessive backup mentality."

- text: "The best time to test your backups is right after you need them. The second best time is never, apparently."

- text: "I ran a disk cleanup utility and freed up 2GB of space. The system immediately filled it with logs about how much space I freed."
  explanation: "Recursive absurdity showing how maintenance tasks can be self-defeating, creating the problems they solve."

- text: "Why do sysadmins make terrible gardeners? Because when they see 'pruning old branches,' they immediately think about Git, not plants, and end up deleting production."
  explanation: "Multi-layered wordplay connecting maintenance concepts across domains, with an escalating punchline about catastrophic consequences."

- text: "Our maintenance schedule follows the ancient IT proverb: 'Never touch a running system unless it's on fire. Then touch it frantically while crying.'"
  explanation: "Exaggerated wisdom literature parody that captures the emotional journey from avoidance to panic, using escalating absurdity."

  explanation: "Extended narrative joke building tension around technical debt, where success becomes its own trap, reflecting real maintenance paralysis."

- text: "I finally figured out why our system requires maintenance every weekend. It doesn't. But if I don't schedule it, management thinks I'm not working, and if I do schedule it, I can't be blamed when things break on Monday. It's preventive career maintenance."
