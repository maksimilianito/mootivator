- text: "I always read the terms and conditions. Said no one ever."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the universal truth that people routinely accept digital agreements without reading them, highlighting the gap between ethical digital behavior and actual practice. The humor comes from the stark contrast between what we should do and what we actually do."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to use facial recognition? He valued his privacy, but mostly he just didn't want to be recognized in public."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection, setting up an expectation of ethical concern about surveillance technology, then deflating it with a mundane social anxiety punchline. It gently mocks how we sometimes rationalize our choices with noble reasons when simpler motivations exist."
  rating: 7

- text: "My password is so secure, even I can't remember it. That's called distributed securityâ€”I distributed it across three sticky notes."
  explanation: "The humor comes from the incongruity between the concept of 'distributed security' (a legitimate cybersecurity practice) and the terrible security practice of writing passwords on sticky notes. It highlights how people misunderstand and misapply security concepts."
  rating: 8

- text: "I'm not saying our data collection is invasive, but our AI knows you're reading this joke right now. And it thinks you should laugh harder."
  explanation: "This meta-joke creates discomfort through the possibility of surveillance while simultaneously commenting on itself. The absurdist addition of the AI judging your laughter response adds a layer of superiority theory humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "The ethics committee approved our AI. They were all bots, but still."
  explanation: "A short, punchy joke that uses circular logic to highlight concerns about AI oversight and accountability. The deadpan delivery ('but still') emphasizes the absurdity of machines judging machines."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't hackers ever feel guilty? Because they always find a loophole in their conscience."
  explanation: "This joke applies programming concepts (loopholes) to moral philosophy. It plays on the stereotype of hackers as rule-benders while using wordplay to connect technical and ethical thinking."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our company takes digital responsibility seriously. We're responsible for at least 60% of your screen time."
  explanation: "The humor comes from redefining 'digital responsibility' from its ethical meaning (being responsible users/creators of technology) to simply taking credit for addictive design. It's a commentary on how companies co-opt ethical language."
  rating: 7

- text: "I anonymized the data so well that even the users can't find their own information. Privacy achieved!"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the tension between data privacy and data utility through absurdist exaggeration. Taking privacy to an illogical extreme exposes the challenges of ethical data handling."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer get into ethical hacking? Because unethical hacking didn't have good benefits."
  explanation: "A setup-punchline structure that deflates the noble concept of ethical hacking with mundane career concerns. It uses misdirection to comment on how people sometimes choose ethical paths for practical rather than moral reasons."
  rating: 6

- text: "We don't sell your data. We lease it with an option to buy."
  explanation: "This short joke uses business terminology to expose how companies parse language around data practices. The technical distinction between selling and leasing becomes absurd when applied to personal information."
  rating: 8

- text: "A programmer's moral compass points north, south, east, west, and undefined."
  explanation: "This joke plays with programming concepts (undefined values) and applies them to ethics. It suggests that programmers face moral ambiguity, with the 'undefined' state being particularly relevant to edge cases in ethical decision-making."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the AI ethicist quit? The job was too automated."
  explanation: "A recursive irony joke where the person responsible for AI ethics is replaced by automation. It comments on the paradox of using AI to govern AI, delivered in a simple question-answer format."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't have trust issues with technology. I just verify everything. Twice. With a third-party audit. And a backup plan."
  explanation: "This joke escalates from reasonable caution to paranoia, highlighting how awareness of digital security and privacy issues can lead to anxiety. It's relatable while exaggerating for comedic effect."
  rating: 6

- text: "The dark web isn't really dark. It's more of a morally ambiguous gray web with questionable lighting."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the metaphorical language used to describe parts of the internet, applying literal interpretation and nuance to expose how simplified terminology obscures complex ethical realities."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't blockchain evangelists ever lie? Because the truth is immutable, transparent, and distributed across their entire social network."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes blockchain culture by applying blockchain properties to personal behavior. It's a commentary on how technological features become ideological positions, delivered with technical accuracy."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our cookie policy is simple: we take all the cookies. You get the crumbs of privacy we're legally required to leave."
  explanation: "A metaphorical extension of browser cookies to actual cookies creates a vivid image of data exploitation. The humor comes from the honest admission of minimal compliance with privacy regulations."
  rating: 9

- text: "A software engineer, a data scientist, and a lawyer walk into a bar. The bartender asks, 'Who's responsible for this AI?' They all pointed at each other and left."
  explanation: "This joke uses the classic 'walks into a bar' setup to address the serious issue of accountability gaps in AI development. The punchline of mutual blame-shifting reflects real-world challenges in assigning responsibility for algorithmic decisions."
  rating: 7

- text: "I'm not saying our terms of service are long, but by the time you finish reading them, they've been updated three times and you've agreed to things that haven't been invented yet."
  explanation: "This joke uses temporal paradox and exaggeration to highlight how terms of service are deliberately made inaccessible. It touches on consent, corporate practices, and the impossibility of informed agreement in modern digital services."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer create an ethical AI? Because the unethical one kept winning at poker and he was tired of losing money."
  explanation: "This joke inverts the typical narrative of AI ethics, suggesting that ethical AI development might be motivated by personal loss rather than moral conviction. The absurdist scenario of AI poker games adds to the humor while commenting on how we anthropomorphize AI behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "We've achieved perfect transparency in our data practices. Unfortunately, we made it transparent by displaying it in 2-point font, white text on a white background, in a PDF that crashes most browsers."
  explanation: "This joke uses technical malicious compliance to satirize how companies claim transparency while making information practically inaccessible. The escalating technical obstacles create a vivid picture of deliberate obfuscation disguised as openness."
  rating: 9

- text: "A quantum computer was accused of unethical behavior. It claimed it was both guilty and innocent until observed by an ethics committee. The committee observed it, the wave function collapsed, and somehow the computer was promoted to management."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke combines quantum mechanics concepts with corporate ethics, using superposition as a metaphor for moral ambiguity. The punchline about promotion to management adds a cynical layer about how ethical violations are handled in corporate structures, making it a multi-layered commentary on technology, physics, and organizational behavior."
