- text: "I tried reading the MIT License, but it was too permissive with my time."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'permissive' - the MIT License is known as a permissive open-source license (allowing broad usage), while also suggesting it was too lenient or wasteful with the reader's time."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer choose the Apache License? Because it came with patent protection and a free cup of coffee."
  explanation: "This joke references the Apache License's patent grant clause while adding an absurd literal interpretation of the 'Apache' name, as if it were related to a coffee brand."
  rating: 5

- text: "GPL stands for 'Generally Pretty Long' - have you seen version 3?"
  explanation: "The GPL (GNU General Public License) is famously lengthy and detailed. This joke plays on creating a fake acronym that describes one of its most notorious characteristics."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code is like the BSD license - simple, clear, and nobody reads it anyway."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke compares the simplicity of BSD licenses with the unfortunate reality that many developers don't read either licenses or other people's code carefully."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't proprietary software licenses go to parties? They have too many restrictions on distribution."
  explanation: "This joke personifies software licenses and plays on the word 'distribution' - both sharing software and distributing party invitations."
  rating: 6

- text: "I released my code under the 'Do Whatever You Want But Don't Blame Me' license. Turns out that's just MIT with better marketing."
  explanation: "This joke accurately captures the essence of permissive licenses like MIT, which essentially allow nearly unrestricted use with minimal liability for the author."

- text: "A developer walks into a bar and orders a beer under the Creative Commons license. The bartender says, 'You can drink it, remix it, but you must attribute the original brewer.'"
  explanation: "This joke applies Creative Commons licensing terms (typically used for creative works) to an absurd everyday scenario, highlighting the 'attribution' requirement."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the startup avoid GPL? They wanted to keep their code closed-source, their options open, and their lawyers employed."
  explanation: "This joke references the GPL's copyleft requirement (which requires derivative works to be open-source) and the common business practice of avoiding it for commercial reasons."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a license that requires users to star my GitHub repo. My lawyer said that's not legally enforceable. My ego said otherwise."
  explanation: "This joke plays on developers' desire for GitHub stars (social validation) and the reality that you can't create legally binding requirements for such things in a license."
  rating: 9

- text: "The difference between open source and free software? About 20 years of philosophical arguments and the same code."
  explanation: "This joke references the famous ideological split between the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative, despite often licensing software identically."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer read all 10,000 words of the EULA? He didn't. Nobody does. That's the joke."
  explanation: "This anti-joke format highlights the absurd length of End User License Agreements and the universal truth that virtually nobody reads them completely."
  rating: 7

- text: "I forked a GPL project and made it proprietary. My lawyer had a heart attack. My code compiled though, which was nice."
  explanation: "This joke describes a serious license violation (GPL requires derivatives to remain open-source) with comedic understatement, prioritizing technical success over legal compliance."
  rating: 8

- text: "Copyleft: because 'copyright but opposite' was too straightforward for lawyers."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the term 'copyleft' (a play on copyright) and suggests that legal terminology is unnecessarily complex when simpler language would suffice."
  rating: 6

- text: "A programmer's wife asks: 'Can you go to the store?' He replies: 'Sure, what license?' She says: 'What?' He says: 'Sorry, I've been reviewing dependencies all day.'"
  explanation: "This joke shows how deeply license concerns can infiltrate a developer's mindset, to the point of absurdly applying software licensing concepts to everyday requests."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the company create their own license? Because 'Not Invented Here' syndrome applies to legal documents too."
  explanation: "This joke references the 'Not Invented Here' syndrome (where companies reject external solutions) and applies it to the proliferation of custom software licenses."
  rating: 7

- text: "I chose the Unlicense for my project. Now my code is public domain and my imposter syndrome is real domain."
  explanation: "This joke plays on 'public domain' versus 'real domain' while incorporating the common developer experience of imposter syndrome when releasing code publicly."
  rating: 8

- text: "The AGPL is like GPL but for people who really, really don't trust cloud providers. And honestly, can you blame them?"
  explanation: "This joke explains the AGPL (Affero GPL), which closes the 'SaaS loophole' in GPL, while acknowledging legitimate concerns about cloud services and open source."
  rating: 7

- text: "My manager asked why I spent three hours choosing a license. I explained it's like a prenup for code - you hope you never need it, but you'll be glad you thought it through when someone forks your repo and sells it as an NFT."
  explanation: "This joke uses the prenup analogy to explain the importance of software licensing while adding a contemporary absurdist twist about NFTs, highlighting modern concerns about code exploitation."
  rating: 9

- text: "A developer dies and meets St. Peter, who says: 'Before entering heaven, you must read every software license you clicked 'I Agree' to.' The developer replies: 'So this is hell?'"
  explanation: "This joke creates a comedic afterlife scenario that plays on the universal guilt of agreeing to licenses without reading them, suggesting that actually reading them would be eternal punishment."

- text: "Why do developers love the WTFPL? Because after debugging for 12 hours, 'Do What The F*** You Want' is exactly how everyone feels about everything."
  explanation: "This joke references the humorously named WTFPL (Do What The F*** You Want To Public License) and connects it to the emotional exhaustion of debugging, suggesting that extreme permissiveness mirrors developer burnout."
  rating: 8

- text: "I released my code under dual licensing: MIT for people who star the repo, and GPL for people who don't. My lawyer quit. My GitHub stars tripled. Sometimes chaos is the best business model."
  explanation: "This joke describes an absurd and legally questionable licensing scheme that somehow succeeds, satirizing both the complexity of dual licensing and developers' obsession with GitHub metrics while suggesting that unconventional approaches can yield unexpected results."
