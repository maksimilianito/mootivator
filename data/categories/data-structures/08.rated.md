- text: "My linked list keeps pointing to NULL. Guess it's just not that into relationships."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'relationships' - both the concept of romantic connections and the technical concept of pointers in linked lists. When a pointer is NULL, it means it doesn't point to anything, creating a humorous parallel with someone being uninterested in relationships."

- text: "Why did the array go to therapy? It had zero-based issues."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'zero-based indexing' (a fundamental array concept where counting starts at 0) and the phrase 'deep-seated issues.' The joke suggests the array's problems stem from its fundamental nature of starting at zero."

- text: "A stack walked into a bar. The bartender said, 'What'll it be?' The stack replied, 'I'll have whatever I had last.'"
  explanation: "This joke exploits the LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of stacks, where the most recently added item is always accessed first. The stack's response humorously personifies this data structure behavior."
  rating: 9

- text: "My binary search tree is so unbalanced, it needs a therapist more than an algorithm."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the double meaning of 'unbalanced' - both the technical concept of an unbalanced tree (which affects performance) and the colloquial meaning of being mentally or emotionally unstable."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't hash tables ever get invited to parties? They're always causing collisions."
  explanation: "This plays on 'hash collisions' (when two keys map to the same location) and the social meaning of causing conflicts or arguments at social gatherings."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my circular linked list a joke. It's still laughing."
  explanation: "This exploits the structure of circular linked lists where the last node points back to the first, creating an endless loop. The joke suggests the list is stuck in an infinite loop of laughter."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the queue break up with the stack? It was tired of being pushed around."
  explanation: "This uses the technical operations 'push' (adding to a stack) and creates a contrast with the queue's FIFO nature, while also playing on the phrase 'being pushed around' meaning being bullied or controlled."
  rating: 8

- text: "My heap is so disorganized, even its parent-child relationships are dysfunctional."
  explanation: "This plays on the parent-child node relationships in heap data structures while using the psychological term 'dysfunctional relationships,' creating humor through applying family therapy concepts to data structures."
  rating: 7

- text: "A programmer's spouse asked, 'Why do you spend so much time with trees?' He replied, 'Because they have depth.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'depth' - both the technical concept of tree depth/height and the metaphorical meaning of having substance or meaning, suggesting the programmer finds data structures more interesting than human interaction."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the graph go to a networking event? To make more connections."
  explanation: "This plays on 'connections' meaning both edges in a graph data structure and professional/social connections at networking events, creating a simple but effective double meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "I implemented a doubly linked list for my relationship status. Now I can go back to my ex more efficiently."
  explanation: "This humorously applies the bidirectional navigation feature of doubly linked lists (where you can traverse both forward and backward) to the concept of returning to previous romantic partners."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the array always stressed? It couldn't handle the constant random access."
  explanation: "This plays on 'random access' (arrays' ability to access any element directly) and the phrase 'constant access,' suggesting the array is overwhelmed by being accessed too frequently, like someone who can't get privacy."
  rating: 7

- text: "My trie is so pretentious. It insists on being called a 'prefix tree' at formal functions."
  explanation: "This personifies a trie data structure with snobbish behavior, playing on how tries are also known as prefix trees, and humorously suggesting it prefers the more formal-sounding name in certain social contexts."
  rating: 7

- text: "A queue and a stack walked into a database. The queue said, 'After you.' The stack said, 'No, after YOU.' They're still arguing."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the fundamental opposition between FIFO (First In, First Out for queues) and LIFO (Last In, First Out for stacks), personifying them as overly polite entities whose core natures prevent them from agreeing on who goes first."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the programmer use a deque for dating? So they could insert themselves at either end of the relationship."
  explanation: "This exploits the deque's (double-ended queue) ability to add and remove elements from both ends, applying it humorously to the flexibility or perhaps opportunism in romantic situations."
  rating: 6

- text: "My red-black tree keeps having an identity crisis. One day it's red, next day it's black. I told it to pick a color and commit."
  explanation: "This plays on red-black trees' self-balancing property where nodes change colors during rotations, personifying this as an identity crisis and using 'commit' both in the sense of dedication and as a git/version control reference."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't linked lists ever win races? By the time they find the finish line, arrays have already indexed it."
  explanation: "This contrasts the O(n) traversal time of linked lists with the O(1) random access time of arrays, creating humor through the competitive metaphor of a race where arrays' direct access gives them an unfair advantage."
  rating: 8

- text: "A skip list walked into a job interview. The interviewer asked about its background. It said, 'I'll skip the boring parts.'"
  explanation: "This brilliantly plays on the skip list's fundamental property of having multiple levels that allow 'skipping' elements during search, applying it to the common interview advice of keeping your story concise."
  rating: 9

- text: "My B-tree has so many children, it qualifies for a tax deduction. My binary tree is jealous."
  explanation: "This contrasts B-trees (which can have many children per node) with binary trees (maximum two children), creating humor by applying tax law concepts to data structures and personifying them with sibling rivalry."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the adjacency matrix break up with the adjacency list? It said, 'You're too sparse for my dense personality.'"
  explanation: "This creates sophisticated humor using graph representation methods - adjacency matrices work better for dense graphs while adjacency lists excel with sparse graphs. The joke personifies these preferences as personality conflicts in a relationship."
  rating: 9

- text: "A programmer implemented a self-balancing tree for work-life balance. Now whenever he leans too far into work, it automatically rotates him toward vacation. His boss is not amused."
  explanation: "This is a multi-layered joke applying AVL or red-black tree rotation mechanisms to life balance, creating an absurd but clever parallel between algorithmic self-balancing and maintaining healthy life priorities, with the added twist of workplace conflict."
