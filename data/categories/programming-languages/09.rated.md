- text: "Python: where whitespace is not a suggestion, it's a relationship status."
  explanation: "This joke plays on Python's strict indentation requirements, comparing them to the seriousness of relationship commitments. The humor comes from the unexpected comparison between programming syntax rules and human relationships."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C#!"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke that uses the pronunciation of 'C#' (C-sharp) as 'see sharp,' creating a pun about vision and programming language names."
  rating: 4

- text: "Rust developers don't have bugs. They have 'borrow checker disagreements.'"
  explanation: "This joke references Rust's notorious borrow checker, which enforces memory safety. The humor lies in the euphemistic reframing of compilation errors as mere 'disagreements,' mimicking corporate speak."
  rating: 7

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, 'Can I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "This personifies a SQL query and uses the double meaning of 'join' - both the social act of joining people at tables and the SQL JOIN operation that combines database tables."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#. Why do C# developers wear glasses? Because they don't Java."
  explanation: "A meta-joke that plays on programming language rivalry while using the same pun structure twice, creating humor through repetition and mutual exclusivity."
  rating: 5

- text: "In C, you shoot yourself in the foot. In C++, you accidentally create a dozen instances of your foot and shoot them all."
  explanation: "This references the classic 'shooting yourself in the foot' programming metaphor, highlighting how C++'s object-oriented features can multiply simple mistakes into complex disasters."
  rating: 9

- text: "Assembly language: because sometimes you need to tell the computer exactly which electrons to move where."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the low-level nature of assembly language, humorously suggesting it's so detailed you're managing individual electrons, highlighting the contrast with high-level languages."
  rating: 7

- text: "PHP: the language where '$' is not about money, but somehow you still feel robbed."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke about PHP's syntax using '$' for variables, combined with a dig at PHP's reputation for inconsistencies, creating humor through the double meaning of feeling 'robbed.'"
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Lisp programmer get lost? Because he couldn't find his way out of all those parentheses."
  explanation: "Lisp is famous for its extensive use of nested parentheses. This joke visualizes them as a physical maze, turning a syntax characteristic into a spatial problem."
  rating: 6

- text: "Go: where error handling is not optional, it's 50% of your codebase."
  explanation: "This jokes about Go's explicit error handling pattern requiring 'if err != nil' checks after almost every operation, humorously suggesting it dominates the code."
  rating: 8

- text: "A Haskell programmer walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'What'll it be?' The programmer says, 'I'll let you know once I've evaluated all possible options in a pure, side-effect-free manner.'"
  explanation: "This mocks Haskell's pure functional programming paradigm, where functions avoid side effects. The humor comes from applying this rigorous approach to a simple drink order."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why don't TypeScript developers ever get lost? Because they always know their type."
  explanation: "A double entendre using 'type' to mean both TypeScript's type system and personality type, suggesting TypeScript's strict typing gives developers clarity and direction."
  rating: 5

- text: "Perl: the only language where '$@%&*' is not cursing, it's just Tuesday."
  explanation: "Perl uses special characters like $, @, %, & for different variable types. The joke suggests these symbols look like censored profanity, which feels appropriate given Perl's reputation for cryptic code."
  rating: 9

- text: "A COBOL programmer dies and goes to heaven. God says, 'Welcome! We need you to maintain some legacy systems.' The programmer replies, 'So nothing's changed?'"
  explanation: "This jokes about COBOL's primary modern use: maintaining ancient banking and government systems. The punchline suggests even heaven has legacy code problems, and COBOL programmers can never escape their fate."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the Kotlin developer break up with Java? She said he was too verbose and she needed someone more expressive."
  explanation: "This personifies the relationship between Kotlin and Java, referencing how Kotlin was designed to be more concise than Java while maintaining interoperability, framing language design as a romantic incompatibility."
  rating: 6

- text: "In Python, everything is an object. In JavaScript, everything is an object. In Ruby, everything is an object. In Java, everything is an object, but first you need to write a factory pattern to create the object that creates the factory that creates the object."
  explanation: "This escalates from simple statements about object-oriented languages to mocking Java's reputation for over-engineering and excessive abstraction layers, using repetition for comedic effect."
  rating: 10

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks, 'Could you go to the store and get a gallon of milk, and if they have eggs, get a dozen?' The programmer returns with 12 gallons of milk. The spouse asks, 'Why did you get so much milk?' The programmer replies, 'They had eggs.'"
  explanation: "A classic joke about literal interpretation. The conditional 'if they have eggs' is parsed as modifying the quantity of milk rather than being a separate request, demonstrating how programmers think in control flow."
  rating: 10

- text: "Swift: where optionals are mandatory, and mandatory things are optional. It's Schrödinger's type system."
  explanation: "This plays on Swift's optional type system where you must explicitly handle nil values, creating a paradox where dealing with 'optional' values becomes mandatory. The Schrödinger reference adds a layer of quantum uncertainty humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Ruby developer always seem so happy? Because she had a gem for every problem, and when those didn't work, she just monkey-patched reality itself."
  explanation: "This references Ruby's package manager (gems) and its controversial ability to modify existing classes at runtime (monkey patching). The escalation to 'patching reality' humorously suggests Ruby developers have god-like powers."
  rating: 7

- text: "A C programmer, a C++ programmer, and a Rust programmer walk into a bar. The C programmer orders a drink and immediately forgets to free the memory. The C++ programmer orders a drink, wraps it in a smart pointer, and lectures everyone about RAII. The Rust programmer tries to order a drink, but the bartender says, 'Sorry, you can't have a mutable reference to that glass while someone else is looking at it.'"
  explanation: "This joke masterfully captures the essence of three languages' memory management: C's manual memory management and common leaks, C++'s smart pointers and verbose best practices, and Rust's strict compile-time borrow checking that prevents concurrent access, all through the metaphor of ordering drinks."
  rating: 10

- text: "Scala: where you can write object-oriented code, functional code, or both simultaneously while questioning every life choice that led you to a codebase with 47 different ways to iterate over a collection."
  explanation: "This captures Scala's multi-paradigm nature and the paradox of choice it creates. The specific number '47' adds absurdist humor while genuinely reflecting developers' frustration with Scala's complexity and the overwhelming number of ways to accomplish simple tasks."
