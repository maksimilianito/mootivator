- text: "Documentation is like a love letter to your future self—except you never write it."
  explanation: "This joke uses the metaphor of a love letter (something personal and important) to highlight the irony that developers know documentation is valuable but still avoid writing it. The incongruity between the romantic notion and the reality creates humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the API documentation go to therapy? It had commitment issues."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'commitment'—both the personal psychological issue and the common problem of incomplete or abandoned documentation projects. The personification of documentation adds to the absurdity."
  rating: 6

- text: "The best documentation is the code itself, said every developer who never had to maintain their own code from six months ago."
  explanation: "This uses irony and the superiority theory—we laugh at the naive developer who doesn't realize their past self will become a stranger. It's a common experience that makes it relatable."
  rating: 9

- text: "README.md: 'TODO: Add documentation.' Last updated: 3 years ago."
  explanation: "This brief observation captures the tragic comedy of good intentions never realized. The timestamp adds specificity that amplifies the humor through exaggeration of a real problem."
  rating: 9

- text: "I don't always write documentation, but when I do, I make sure to use phrases like 'obviously' and 'simply' before the most confusing parts."
  explanation: "This misdirection joke sets up the expectation of good documentation practices, then subverts it by highlighting how developers often make documentation worse with condescending language that assumes knowledge."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a fairy tale and a software project? A fairy tale begins with 'Once upon a time,' while a software project begins with 'The code is self-documenting.'"
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses parallel structure to equate two types of fiction. The punchline reveals that 'self-documenting code' is as mythical as fairy tales, playing on shared developer frustrations."
  rating: 7

- text: "Documentation status: Schrödinger's manual—it both exists and doesn't exist until someone needs it."
  explanation: "This applies quantum physics humor to documentation, suggesting that documentation's existence is uncertain until observed (needed). It's a sophisticated reference that technical audiences appreciate."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code is so well-documented that I included a 'Table of Contents' section. It's empty, but it's there."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke creates humor through the logical contradiction of having a table of contents with nothing in it, satirizing the minimal effort some developers put into documentation."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do developers hate writing documentation? Because every sentence they write is a commit to explaining their past mistakes."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay with 'commit' (both a git action and a personal obligation) while touching on the psychological discomfort of documenting code that may not be perfect, creating layered humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "The documentation says 'See Figure 1.' There is no Figure 1. There never was a Figure 1. Figure 1 is a lie we tell ourselves to feel productive."
  explanation: "This escalating absurdity joke starts with a simple error and builds into existential comedy, exaggerating the common experience of incomplete or broken documentation references."
  rating: 8

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation once. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "This short, punchy joke uses the dream format to suggest that complete documentation is so rare it can only exist in fantasy. The brevity enhances the impact."
  rating: 7

- text: "How many developers does it take to write documentation? Nobody knows—the experiment is still ongoing."
  explanation: "This twist on the classic light bulb joke format suggests that documentation writing is so rare that we've never actually observed it happening, playing with scientific observation humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Our API documentation has three states: 'Coming Soon,' 'Deprecated,' and 'Ask Steve (who left the company two years ago).'"
  explanation: "This joke uses the rule of three to escalate from bad to worse to absurd, reflecting the real lifecycle of many documentation projects and the knowledge loss when employees leave."
  rating: 9

- text: "I added comments to my code. They said 'Good luck' and 'I'm sorry.' I consider this comprehensive documentation."
  explanation: "This subverts expectations about what constitutes documentation by offering only apologetic warnings instead of explanations, reflecting the gallows humor developers share about legacy code."
  rating: 8

- text: "The manual was so detailed it included instructions on how to read the manual. Nobody read either part."
  explanation: "This recursive absurdity creates humor through the paradox of meta-documentation that defeats its own purpose, while also commenting on the reality that documentation often goes unread regardless of quality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the documentation file go to the gym? To work on its structure. It's still unstructured."
  explanation: "This personification joke plays on the double meaning of 'structure' (physical fitness and document organization) while the punchline reveals the effort was futile, a common documentation experience."
  rating: 5

- text: "My documentation follows the DRY principle: Don't Record Yourself. Wait, that's not right."
  explanation: "This clever wordplay subverts the well-known 'Don't Repeat Yourself' programming principle by replacing it with an excuse for not documenting, revealing the mental gymnastics developers use to avoid documentation."
  rating: 8

- text: "The code comments were so old they were written in Latin. 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet' was surprisingly accurate."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke references placeholder text while suggesting the documentation is both ancient and meaningless, creating humor through the absurd comparison and the ironic accuracy of placeholder text for useless comments."
  rating: 7

- text: "I found documentation that said 'This function is self-explanatory.' The function was 847 lines long and used recursion, callbacks, and prayer."
  explanation: "This builds tension through escalating complexity (recursion, callbacks, then the absurd 'prayer'), mocking the arrogance of calling anything 'self-explanatory' while painting a hilariously complex scenario."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our documentation strategy is revolutionary: we document everything perfectly in Slack messages that disappear after 90 days. It's like agile, but for institutional memory loss."
  explanation: "This satirizes modern workplace practices by framing a terrible documentation strategy as innovative, using the contrast between 'revolutionary' and the obvious dysfunction to create humor about real organizational problems."
  rating: 10

- text: "The senior developer's documentation technique was legendary: he would stare at the blank page until it documented itself through sheer intimidation. The page always won."
  explanation: "This absurdist narrative creates a mythical figure whose magical documentation powers still fail, combining the superiority theory (laughing at failure) with the fantastical element that makes the failure even more humorous. The personification of the page 'winning' adds an extra layer of comedy."
