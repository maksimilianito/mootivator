- text: "My ISP said they'd improve my connection. Now I'm connected to their customer service instead of the internet."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'connection' - network connectivity versus customer service interaction. The incongruity is that improving internet connection resulted in being stuck on hold with support, which is the opposite of what was promised."

- text: "Why did the router go to therapy? It had too many unresolved connections."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'connections' meaning both network connections and emotional/psychological connections. The joke anthropomorphizes a router by giving it human problems, creating humor through the unexpected application of technical terminology to psychological concepts."
  rating: 6

- text: "I named my WiFi 'Hidden Network' so my neighbors would think they can't see it."
  explanation: "This plays on the technical concept of hidden SSIDs while using reverse psychology. The humor comes from the misdirection - instead of actually hiding the network, the person is using the name itself to create a false impression."

- text: "The web was supposed to connect humanity. Instead, it connected us to loading screens."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and the relief theory - acknowledging the frustration of slow internet speeds versus the lofty promise of global connectivity. The incongruity between expectation and reality creates the humor."

- text: "Why don't networks ever win at poker? Because they always show their packets."
  explanation: "This is a pun on 'packets' (data units in networking) and the poker phrase 'show your cards.' The joke works through double meaning and the absurdity of anthropomorphizing network behavior."
  rating: 5

- text: "My internet is so slow, I clicked on a link yesterday and it's still thinking about it."
  explanation: "This uses exaggeration to highlight the common frustration of slow internet speeds. The personification of the internet 'thinking' adds to the absurdist humor."

- text: "404: Joke Not Found. Please check your sense of humor and try again."
  explanation: "This meta-joke references the common HTTP 404 error while turning it into self-referential humor about jokes themselves. It works on multiple levels for those familiar with web error codes."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break. Now it won't stop sending me vacation ads."
  explanation: "This joke plays on targeted advertising and the surveillance economy of the internet, using the double meaning of 'break' (rest versus breaking something). The incongruity is the overly literal interpretation of casual speech."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the ping packet get lost? It couldn't find its way back home before timing out."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the ping command (used to test network connectivity) by giving it human qualities like getting lost. The technical accuracy of 'timing out' adds authenticity to the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "My bandwidth is like my patience - limited and constantly being exceeded."
  explanation: "This uses analogy to connect technical concepts (bandwidth limitations) with human emotions. The parallel structure creates a relatable comparison that resonates with internet users' frustrations."
  rating: 8

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer. And apparently, it's having a bad day too."
  explanation: "This references the popular tech saying 'the cloud is just someone else's computer' and extends it with the implication that cloud services also experience downtime, deflating the mystique of cloud computing."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the website break up with HTTPS? Too much security in the relationship - no room for vulnerability."
  explanation: "This plays on relationship terminology while referencing the secure HTTPS protocol. The humor comes from applying human relationship dynamics to technical security concepts, with 'vulnerability' working on both levels."

- text: "I'm not saying my ISP is slow, but I started downloading a file in 2019 and it's still buffering the progress bar."
  explanation: "This uses extreme exaggeration and temporal humor to mock slow internet speeds. The absurdity of a multi-year download attempt creates the comedic effect through obvious impossibility."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do networks make terrible comedians? Their timing is always subject to latency."
  explanation: "This joke works because comedic timing is crucial for humor, and network latency (delay) would ruin it. The technical term 'latency' is perfectly applied to explain why networks would fail at comedy."
  rating: 8

- text: "My neighbor's WiFi password is 'incorrect' so when I fail to connect, it tells me 'The password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "This is a clever play on error messages and literal interpretation. The circular logic creates humor through the confusion between the password itself and the error message describing failed authentication."
  rating: 9

- text: "The internet: where you can be anyone you want, but the cookies already know who you really are."
  explanation: "This joke addresses online privacy and tracking cookies with ironic humor. The contrast between the promise of anonymity and the reality of surveillance creates the incongruity."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the DNS server go to the bar? To resolve its internal conflicts by translating hostility into addresses."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated wordplay using DNS terminology (resolving domain names to IP addresses) and applying it to psychological concepts. Multiple layers of technical and emotional meaning create depth."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to catch some fog yesterday. Mist. Then I tried to download it. Cloud."
  explanation: "This joke uses pun progression, moving from a classic joke format to a technical punchline about cloud computing. The unexpected technical twist on a familiar joke structure creates surprise."
  rating: 7

- text: "My ISP offers unlimited data, which is technically true - there's no limit to how much they can throttle it."
  explanation: "This uses dark humor and irony to comment on ISP practices. The technical accuracy of 'throttling' combined with the subversion of 'unlimited' creates biting social commentary through humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the packet take the scenic route? Because BGP decided it would be faster to go through three continents than directly to the next building."
  explanation: "This is sophisticated networking humor about BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing inefficiencies. The absurdist reality that internet traffic sometimes takes geographically illogical paths makes this both funny and educational."
  rating: 8

- text: "There are two types of people: those who backup their data, and those who will. The internet is the third type - it loses your data before you even decide."
  explanation: "This builds on a classic joke format but adds an unexpected third category. The escalation from personal responsibility to internet unreliability creates layered humor with a cynical edge about online data storage."
