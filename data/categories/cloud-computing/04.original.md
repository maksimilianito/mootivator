- text: "I moved my files to the cloud. Now it's raining data."
  explanation: "A simple play on the literal meaning of 'cloud' versus the technical term 'cloud computing,' creating a visual absurdity of weather affecting digital storage."

- text: "Why did the server go to therapy? It had attachment issues."
  explanation: "Uses the double meaning of 'attachment' - both the technical term for connected storage/files and the psychological concept of emotional attachment problems."

- text: "My cloud storage is like my refrigerator - I never remember what's in there until it's too late."
  explanation: "Compares the common experience of forgotten cloud files to the relatable situation of forgotten food, highlighting the 'out of sight, out of mind' nature of remote storage."

- text: "Virtualization: Because one computer pretending to be many is less suspicious than many computers pretending to be one."
  explanation: "A paradoxical observation about virtualization that plays with the incongruity of the technology's purpose while adding a humorous conspiratorial tone."

- text: "What's a cloud engineer's favorite weather? Partly serverless with a chance of containers."
  explanation: "Combines weather terminology with cloud computing terms (serverless architecture and containers) to create a technical weather forecast pun."

- text: "I tried to explain cloud computing to my grandma. She asked if I needed an umbrella for my laptop."
  explanation: "Classic generational misunderstanding joke that exploits the literal interpretation of 'cloud' by someone unfamiliar with the technical term."

- text: "Why don't clouds ever get lost? They always know their IP address."
  explanation: "Simple wordplay connecting the concept of location/navigation with the technical reality that cloud servers have IP addresses for identification."

- text: "My company moved to the cloud to save money. Now we just pay rent instead of a mortgage."
  explanation: "Clever economic metaphor comparing on-premises infrastructure ownership to cloud subscription models, highlighting that 'saving' is relative."

- text: "What do you call a cloud service that never goes down? A myth."
  explanation: "Self-aware humor about cloud reliability that acknowledges the reality of outages while setting up the expectation of perfect uptime."

- text: "I asked the cloud provider about their uptime guarantee. They said '99.9%' - I said 'What about the other 0.1%?' They said 'That's when you'll need us most.'"
  explanation: "Dark humor about Murphy's Law in cloud services, where the guaranteed downtime always seems to occur at the worst possible moment."

- text: "Virtualization is just computers doing impressions of other computers. Some are better at it than others."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizes virtual machines as performers, adding personality to the technical concept while acknowledging performance variations."

- text: "Why did the developer break up with their cloud provider? Too much latency in the relationship."
  explanation: "Applies the technical problem of network latency to romantic relationships, creating a double meaning about delays and responsiveness."

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer. That someone else is having a really good day financially."
  explanation: "References the famous tech saying 'there is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer' while adding commentary on cloud providers' profitability."

- text: "I put all my eggs in one basket, then put that basket in the cloud. Now I have redundant eggs across three availability zones."
  explanation: "Subverts the traditional warning about risk concentration by applying cloud architecture best practices (multi-zone redundancy) to the old saying."

- text: "What's the difference between cloud computing and fog computing? About 500 feet and a marketing department."
  explanation: "Satirizes the tech industry's tendency to rebrand similar concepts, while referencing the actual technical difference between cloud and edge/fog computing."

- text: "My boss asked me to move everything to the cloud. I said 'Even your unrealistic expectations?' He said 'Especially those - they're too heavy for on-premises.'"
  explanation: "Uses the metaphor of cloud storage to comment on workplace dynamics, suggesting that unrealistic expectations are being outsourced along with infrastructure."

- text: "Why do cloud engineers make terrible meteorologists? Because when they say 'mostly sunny,' they mean '99.9% uptime' and that still includes thunderstorms."
  explanation: "Complex joke combining weather prediction with SLA terminology, highlighting how technical precision doesn't translate well to everyday language."

- text: "I told my therapist I live in the cloud. She asked if that's why I seem so disconnected. I said no, that's just the latency."
  explanation: "Multi-layered joke using 'disconnected' both as an emotional state and a network condition, with latency serving as both the technical cause and metaphorical excuse."

- text: "A priest, a rabbi, and a cloud architect walk into a bar. The bartender says 'Is this some kind of distributed system?' The cloud architect says 'Yes, but we're only eventually consistent.'"
  explanation: "Subverts the classic joke setup by applying database consistency models to human behavior, suggesting the three religious figures don't always agree but eventually reach consensus."

- text: "Why did the VM go to the gym? It wanted better container support. The physical trainer said 'You're already running on bare metal.' The VM replied 'That's my problem - I'm having an identity crisis.'"
  explanation: "Sophisticated joke layering multiple virtualization concepts (VMs, containers, bare metal) with existential humor about the VM questioning its own nature and purpose."

- text: "A developer dies and goes to heaven. St. Peter says 'Welcome to the cloud!' The developer asks 'What's the uptime SLA?' St. Peter replies 'Eternal.' The developer says 'So you're saying there's a catch?' St. Peter sighs, 'Yes - the documentation is still in beta and nobody knows where anything is stored.'"
  explanation: "Extended narrative joke that uses the afterlife as the ultimate cloud service, combining religious concepts with technical realities like SLAs, documentation problems, and data location uncertainty, suggesting even paradise has the same issues as earthly cloud services."
