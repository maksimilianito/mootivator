- text: "A Buddhist monk approaches a hot dog vendor and says, 'Make me one with everything.' The vendor hands him a hot dog.

The 'change from within' becomes literal (internal system changes) while maintaining the philosophical meaning, creating a perfect triple-meaning punchline that ties together spirituality, the original joke, and Linux culture."
