- text: "My hard drive crashed. Now it's just a hard sit."
  explanation: "A simple play on words where 'drive' (which implies motion) becomes 'sit' (which implies stillness) after the crash, mimicking how hardware failure renders a component useless. The joke uses minimal words for maximum impact, relying on the incongruity between the active and passive states."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the RAM go to therapy? It had too many issues to address."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'address' - both the psychological concept of dealing with problems and the technical term for memory locations in RAM. The setup creates expectation of a psychological problem, while the punchline delivers a technical wordplay."

- text: "My motherboard died. The funeral was very emotional - everyone was in tears, especially the capacitors."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes computer components, with 'capacitors' creating a visual pun since failed capacitors often leak electrolytic fluid that looks like tears. It combines the incongruity of a funeral for hardware with actual component failure symptoms."

- text: "The hard drive made a clicking noise. I told it to stay positive, but it just kept seeking attention."
  explanation: "The 'click of death' is a real hard drive failure symptom. The joke plays on 'seeking' (the physical movement of drive heads) and 'seeking attention' (emotional neediness), while 'stay positive' references both attitude and electrical charge."
  rating: 8

- text: "My computer's fan stopped working. Now it just has critics."
  explanation: "A concise wordplay on 'fan' as both a cooling component and an admirer. When the fan (supporter) stops working, only critics remain. The brevity amplifies the unexpected twist from technical to social commentary."

- text: "Why don't broken power supplies ever win arguments? Because they have no power."
  explanation: "This joke operates on two levels - the literal lack of electrical power in a failed PSU and the metaphorical lack of argumentative power. The setup creates expectation of a complex technical reason, but delivers a simple, obvious truth that's funny through its directness."
  rating: 5

- text: "I asked my failing SSD how it was feeling. It said, 'I'm having a bad sector day.'"
  explanation: "Combines the common phrase 'bad hair day' with the technical term 'bad sector' (a damaged portion of storage). The anthropomorphization of the SSD expressing its technical failure in emotional terms creates the humor through incongruity."
  rating: 7

- text: "My graphics card overheated and now it only displays abstract art."
  explanation: "This joke suggests that hardware failure creates visual artifacts so severe they resemble abstract art. It's funny because it reframes a frustrating technical problem as an unintended creative achievement, using the superiority theory where we laugh at the absurdity of finding a silver lining."
  rating: 8

- text: "The CPU kept overheating. I told it to chill out, but it just had a meltdown."
  explanation: "Uses multiple meanings: 'chill out' as both cooling advice and emotional calming, and 'meltdown' as both psychological breakdown and literal thermal failure. The parallel structure between the advice and the failure creates a satisfying comedic rhythm."

- text: "Why did the network card fail during the presentation? It couldn't handle the bandwidth of expectations."
  explanation: "This joke cleverly merges technical terminology (bandwidth) with emotional concepts (expectations). The timing 'during the presentation' adds relatable stress, while the punchline suggests the hardware failed under social pressure rather than data load."
  rating: 8

- text: "My BIOS chip corrupted itself. Now when I boot up, it just has an existential crisis about whether to POST or not to POST."
  explanation: "A sophisticated reference to Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' soliloquy combined with the technical POST (Power-On Self-Test) process. The joke suggests the BIOS has become philosophical about its basic function, creating humor through the absurdity of existential hardware."
  rating: 9

- text: "The hard drive's read/write head crashed. Now it can only read the room, and badly."
  explanation: "Transforms a catastrophic hardware failure (head crash) into a social incompetence. The phrase 'read the room' (understanding social situations) contrasts with technical 'read' operations, and adding 'badly' emphasizes the complete failure on both levels."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the RAM stick break up with the motherboard? There was no chemistry - wrong voltage, wrong timing, and they just weren't compatible."
  explanation: "Uses relationship terminology to describe actual hardware compatibility issues. The technical terms (voltage, timing, compatibility) are real requirements for RAM to work, but they're framed as relationship problems, creating humor through the unexpected application of romantic language to hardware."
  rating: 7

- text: "My laptop's battery expanded. Now it's more confident, but also more dangerous."
  explanation: "Battery expansion is a serious hardware failure, but the joke treats it as personal growth. The contrast between 'confident' (positive trait) and 'dangerous' (actual consequence) creates dark humor about how hardware failure can be physically hazardous while seeming like self-improvement."
  rating: 9

- text: "The server's cooling system failed at 3 AM. It was a heated moment, followed by a meltdown, then a cold realization that we needed better backup systems."
  explanation: "This joke takes the audience through the emotional journey of a hardware failure using temperature-related wordplay throughout: 'heated' (both hot and angry), 'meltdown' (thermal failure and emotional breakdown), and 'cold realization' (temperature and harsh truth). The narrative structure creates escalating humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't dead capacitors ever tell good stories? Because they've lost their capacity for storytelling."
  explanation: "A multilayered pun on 'capacity' - capacitors store electrical charge (their capacity), and 'capacity' also means ability. The joke anthropomorphizes the component while making a technical observation about component failure, using the setup-punchline structure effectively."
  rating: 6

- text: "My SSD failed after exactly 1,000 write cycles. It was very committed to its specifications, just not to longevity."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony of hardware that faithfully meets its (poor) specifications. The humor comes from praising the SSD's 'commitment' to failing exactly when predicted, treating reliability failure as a form of reliability, which is absurdly funny."
  rating: 8

- text: "The RAID array failed. Turns out RAID doesn't stand for 'Really Awesome Insurance for Data' - it stands for 'Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disappointments.'"
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke that redefines the RAID acronym (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) to reflect user experience with failed arrays. The fake acronym sounds plausible, and the alliteration in 'Inexpensive Disappointments' makes it memorable while highlighting the pain of backup failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the thermal paste file for divorce from the CPU? After years together, the relationship had dried up, and there was no heat between them anymore."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor treats thermal paste degradation as a failing relationship. The technical reality (dried thermal paste causes poor heat transfer) is described using relationship clich√©s, with 'no heat' being both literal (poor thermal transfer) and figurative (lost passion)."
  rating: 8

- text: "My computer's power supply failed during a thunderstorm. The surge protector said, 'I tried to protect you, but you kept letting toxic voltage into your life.' Now I'm in therapy with my UPS, learning about healthy power boundaries."
  explanation: "This joke creates an entire therapeutic narrative around power protection, anthropomorphizing each component. The 'toxic voltage' and 'healthy boundaries' phrases apply self-help language to electrical engineering, creating humor through the absurd but internally consistent metaphor."

- text: "A programmer's computer crashed during deployment. The hard drive failed, the RAM corrupted, the motherboard sparked, and the power supply exploded. He looked at the smoking ruins and said, 'Well, at least it's not a software bug - those are much harder to fix.' Then he ordered new hardware on Amazon Prime and had the system running by morning. His manager asked how he stayed so calm. He replied, 'Hardware failures are just expensive reboots. Software bugs are existential crises that make you question your career choices at 3 AM.'"
  explanation: "This extended joke subverts expectations by suggesting catastrophic hardware failure is preferable to software bugs. It captures the programmer's mindset where physical destruction is merely a purchasing problem, while logic errors are psychological torture. The escalating hardware failures build tension, and the calm response creates humor through extreme incongruity. The final line delivers the philosophical punchline that resonates with anyone who's debugged code at 3 AM, making it both funny and deeply relatable to the programming community."
