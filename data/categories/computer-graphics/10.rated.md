- text: "My shader compiled on the first try. Now I'm worried something's seriously wrong."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory - in computer graphics, shaders are notoriously finicky and rarely compile correctly on the first attempt. The humor comes from the programmer's paranoia that success itself is suspicious, inverting the expected emotion of relief into anxiety."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the 3D artist break up with the renderer? Too many commitment issues - it kept saying 'rendering... 99%' forever."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'commitment' and the universal frustration of renders that seem to freeze at 99%. The relationship metaphor makes the technical frustration relatable."
  rating: 7

- text: "I don't always test my shaders, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "A meme-format joke that uses superiority theory, poking fun at the dangerous practice of testing code in live environments. The casualness of the statement contrasts with the severity of the mistake."
  rating: 6

- text: "GPU utilization: 100%. Fans: screaming. Result: a slightly shinier sphere."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the absurd disparity between computational effort and visual output in graphics programming, using exaggeration to emphasize how demanding rendering can be for minimal results."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do graphics programmers prefer dark mode? Because they spend all day looking at white screens saying 'Segmentation fault.'"
  explanation: "A twist on the classic 'bugs attracted to light' joke, this references the dreaded segmentation fault error that graphics programmers encounter, often displayed on bright error screens."
  rating: 5

- text: "My normal maps are inverted, but honestly, at this point I've lost all sense of direction anyway."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'normal' (both a vector direction and ordinary state) and 'direction' (both technical and life guidance), with self-deprecating humor about the confusion of debugging graphics."
  rating: 8

- text: "Raytracing is just really expensive connect-the-dots for adults."
  explanation: "This joke uses reductionism and incongruity, comparing the sophisticated mathematical technique of raytracing to a simple children's activity, highlighting the fundamental similarity in unexpected ways."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the vertex shader go to therapy? It had too many transformation issues."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke where 'transformation' refers both to the mathematical matrix transformations in graphics and personal psychological change, using the setup-punchline structure effectively."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my manager we need better GPUs. He said 'just optimize your code.' I'm updating my resume."
  explanation: "This reflects the real workplace tension between hardware investment and software optimization, with the punchline showing the programmer's resignation that reveals the futility of the suggestion."
  rating: 8

- text: "Rendering farm: where pixels go to grow up, and your budget goes to die."
  explanation: "A play on 'farm' with dual meanings - render farms for distributed computing and agricultural farms where things grow - while adding dark humor about the expensive cost of rendering."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't graphics programmers trust stairs? Too many edge cases."
  explanation: "This uses technical terminology ('edge cases' in programming) applied to physical objects (the edges of stairs), creating humor through the double meaning and misdirection."
  rating: 7

- text: "My mesh has 10 million polygons. My frame rate has 10 frames. My boss has 10 minutes of patience left."
  explanation: "The parallel structure of three 'tens' creates rhythm, while showing the cascading consequences of poor optimization, building tension toward the workplace consequence punchline."
  rating: 9

- text: "Started learning OpenGL. Three weeks later, I've drawn a triangle. It's the wrong color and upside down, but it's MY triangle."
  explanation: "This captures the genuine struggle of graphics programming beginners with self-deprecating pride, using the relief theory to acknowledge shared frustration while celebrating small victories."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the graphics programmer quit gaming? After debugging shaders all day, they could only see the artifacts."
  explanation: "This joke plays on how professional knowledge ruins enjoyment, with 'artifacts' referring to rendering glitches that graphics programmers notice everywhere, creating humor through occupational hazard."
  rating: 7

- text: "Real-time rendering: where 'good enough' is the enemy of 'my GPU is on fire.'"
  explanation: "A twist on the phrase 'perfect is the enemy of good,' this highlights the constant trade-off in graphics between quality and performance, with absurdist exaggeration about hardware stress."
  rating: 8

- text: "I spent six hours optimizing my fragment shader. Gained 2 FPS. Lost 6 hours. Net result: I'm now running in slow motion IRL."
  explanation: "This uses absurdist humor to extend the computational slowdown into real life, while highlighting the poor return on optimization investment, creating layered humor about time management."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do graphics programmers make terrible poets? They think in vertices, not verses, and all their metaphors need to be normalized first."
  explanation: "This plays on the similarity between 'vertices' and 'verses' while adding technical detail about vector normalization, creating multi-layered wordplay that requires graphics knowledge to fully appreciate."
  rating: 9

- text: "My professor said raytracing is 'just following light rays backwards.' By that logic, cooking is 'just following recipes backwards,' and look how that turned out."
  explanation: "This uses reductio ad absurdum to mock oversimplified explanations of complex topics, with the cooking analogy creating vivid imagery of the chaos that would result."
  rating: 7

- text: "Graphics programming: where you spend 90% of your time making things invisible work correctly, so the 10% that's visible can look wrong in new and exciting ways."
  explanation: "This captures the irony of graphics work - most effort goes into behind-the-scenes math and data structures, only to reveal visual bugs. The phrase 'new and exciting ways' adds sarcastic enthusiasm."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the graphics programmer bring a ladder to work? Because after implementing Z-buffering, they finally understood depth, and realized they'd been working on a whole different level."
  explanation: "This is a triple-layered pun using 'depth' (Z-buffer depth testing), 'level' (both understanding level and physical level), and the literal ladder, creating sophisticated wordplay that rewards technical knowledge."
  rating: 6

- text: "I finally achieved photorealistic rendering. Took 47 hours per frame. Showed it to my client. They said, 'Why didn't you just take a photograph?' I'm now rendering my resignation letter - ETA: 3 business days."
  explanation: "This is a perfect storm of graphics humor: the absurd render time, the client's oblivious but technically correct observation, and the meta-joke about rendering the resignation itself. It captures the existential frustration of graphics work while maintaining playful absurdism throughout."
