- text: "My code works, but I don't know why. My code doesn't work, and I don't know why either."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common debugging experience where programmers often struggle to understand the root cause of both success and failure, emphasizing the mysterious nature of code behavior and the frustration of inconsistent understanding."

- text: "Why do programmers always confuse Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25."
  explanation: "This is a classic programmer joke using octal (base-8) and decimal (base-10) number systems. In octal, 31 equals 25 in decimal (3Ã—8 + 1 = 25), playing on the double meaning of 'Oct' as October and octal, 'Dec' as December and decimal."

- text: "Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses the superiority theory and self-deprecating humor to capture the ironic situation where programmers must investigate bugs they themselves created, combining the roles of investigator and perpetrator."

- text: "I spent 3 hours debugging. The problem was a missing semicolon. I'm not crying, you're crying."
  explanation: "This joke employs relief theory by expressing the common frustration of spending extensive time on a trivial syntax error, using the 'you're crying' meme format to add emotional relatability to a universal programming experience."

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and a feature? Documentation."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity theory to suggest that the only distinction between problematic code and intentional behavior is whether it's written down, satirizing how developers sometimes justify bugs as intentional features."

- text: "My debugging process: 1) It doesn't work. 2) I don't know why. 3) It works! 4) I still don't know why."
  explanation: "This structured joke presents the cyclical nature of debugging where understanding remains elusive even after resolution, highlighting the mysterious and sometimes accidental nature of bug fixes."

- text: "Why did the developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "This pun plays on the double meaning of 'cache' (computer memory) and 'cash' (money), using wordplay to create a simple setup-punchline structure that connects programming concepts with everyday life."

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: "This joke parodies the 'Most Interesting Man in the World' meme while highlighting the dangerous but surprisingly common practice of testing code in live production environments, using irony to emphasize poor debugging practices."

- text: "A programmer's wife sends him to the store: 'Buy a loaf of bread, and if they have eggs, get a dozen.' He returns with 12 loaves of bread."
  explanation: "This classic joke exploits the literal interpretation of conditional logic that programmers develop, where 'if they have eggs' becomes the condition for 'get a dozen' applied to the bread, demonstrating how programming thinking affects real-world behavior."

- text: "There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
  explanation: "This meta-joke lists three things while claiming there are only two, demonstrating an off-by-one error in its own structure. It's self-referential humor that proves its own point about common programming mistakes."

- text: "How do you know debugging is going well? When you add 20 console.log() statements and they all say 'HERE'."
  explanation: "This joke captures the desperate debugging technique of adding print statements with increasingly meaningless labels, showing the progression from methodical debugging to chaotic troubleshooting."

- text: "I finally found the bug after 6 hours. It was a typo in a variable name. The variable was only used once."
  explanation: "This joke emphasizes the disproportionate time investment versus the trivial nature of the bug, highlighting the frustration of debugging where simple mistakes can hide in plain sight for hours."

- text: "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: "This pun uses programming language names (C# pronounced 'C sharp') and the homophone with 'see sharp,' creating a simple wordplay joke that works on the literal level of vision and the figurative level of language knowledge."

- text: "Debugging is like being in a horror movie where the killer is yourself from two weeks ago who didn't comment their code."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor combines the detective theme with horror movie tropes, adding the time-travel element of past self versus present self, and highlighting the importance of code comments for future debugging."

- text: "I told my computer I needed a break. It showed me a stack trace."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'break' (rest versus breakpoint/error) and uses personification of the computer, with the punchline being that the computer interprets the request literally in programming terms."

- text: "Debugging: Where you question every life decision that led you to this moment, including your choice of career, your choice of language, and your choice to name that variable 'x'."
  explanation: "This escalating joke builds from existential crisis to specific technical regret, using hyperbole and the relief theory to express the emotional journey of difficult debugging sessions."

- text: "What's a debugger's favorite music? Heavy metal. All those breakpoints need a good soundtrack."
  explanation: "This joke combines debugging terminology (breakpoints) with music genre wordplay, suggesting that intense debugging sessions deserve equally intense music, creating an unexpected connection between technical work and cultural preferences."

- text: "I don't have bugs in my code. I have undocumented features that require specific conditions to manifest, which I haven't fully explored yet."
  explanation: "This verbose rationalization satirizes how developers justify bugs by reframing them with corporate-speak and technical jargon, using superiority theory to mock the tendency to avoid admitting mistakes."

- text: "The best debugger is the one between your ears. Unfortunately, mine is running out of memory and needs a coffee restart."
  explanation: "This joke anthropomorphizes the brain as a computer system, using technical terminology (memory, restart) to describe human limitations, and adding the relatable element of caffeine dependency in programming culture."

- text: "I fixed a bug. Three more appeared. I'm not debugging anymore, I'm playing whack-a-mole with code."
  explanation: "This joke uses the whack-a-mole metaphor to capture the frustrating reality where fixing one bug often reveals or creates multiple new bugs, expressing the seemingly endless nature of debugging through a vivid game analogy."

- text: "After 8 hours of debugging, I realized the code was working perfectly. The bug was in my understanding of what the code was supposed to do."
  explanation: "This joke delivers the ultimate twist where the problem wasn't technical but conceptual, highlighting how debugging sometimes reveals that our assumptions rather than our code are wrong, combining incongruity with self-deprecating humor for maximum impact."
