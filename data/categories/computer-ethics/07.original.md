- text: "I always read the terms and conditions before clicking 'Accept'... said no one ever."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the universal truth that almost nobody reads lengthy legal documents before agreeing to them, highlighting the gap between ideal digital responsibility and actual practice. The humor comes from the incongruity between what we should do ethically and what we actually do."

- text: "Why did the programmer feel guilty? He used a cookie without asking for consent."
  explanation: "This is a simple pun on browser cookies and actual cookies, playing with the modern requirement for cookie consent notices. It anthropomorphizes the programmer's relationship with web cookies, treating them like stealing physical cookies."

- text: "My code is open source, which means everyone can see my mistakes equally."
  explanation: "This joke touches on the transparency aspect of open source ethics while self-deprecating about code quality. It highlights how ethical transparency also means vulnerability, creating humor through the unexpected downside of doing the 'right thing'."

- text: "Ethics in AI: Teaching machines to make better decisions than we do, which isn't setting the bar very high."
  explanation: "This aphorism uses self-deprecating human superiority theory, pointing out the irony that we're trying to make AI ethical when humans struggle with ethics themselves. The humor comes from the logical paradox of flawed creators trying to create perfect creations."

- text: "I respect user privacy so much, I don't even look at my own data."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration to highlight privacy concerns. The absurdity of not even looking at your own data creates humor while commenting on the extreme measures needed to truly respect privacy in the digital age."

- text: "Why don't hackers ever win at poker? Because they always show their hand in responsible disclosure."
  explanation: "This plays on the ethical hacking practice of responsible disclosure (revealing vulnerabilities to companies before exploiting them) versus the poker term 'showing your hand.' It creates humor by applying technical ethics to a gambling context."

- text: "The trolley problem, but it's choosing between shipping buggy code or missing the deadline."
  explanation: "This references the famous philosophical trolley problem but applies it to the everyday ethical dilemma programmers face. The humor comes from elevating a mundane workplace decision to the level of a classic moral philosophy thought experiment."

- text: "My password is so secure, even I can't remember it. That's what I call data protection."
  explanation: "This joke plays with the incongruity between security best practices and usability. The absurd conclusion that forgetting your own password equals good security highlights the tension between perfect security and practical access."

- text: "I wanted to scrape that website, but then I read their robots.txt file. I'm not a monster."
  explanation: "This joke references robots.txt (a file that tells web crawlers what they can access) and treats following it as a basic moral standard. The humor comes from the exaggerated self-righteousness about following a simple technical guideline."

- text: "Why did the developer go to confession? He committed to the main branch without testing."
  explanation: "This uses religious confession as a metaphor for the 'sin' of pushing untested code to production. It elevates a coding mistake to the level of moral transgression, playing with both Git terminology ('commit') and religious concepts."

- text: "They say with great power comes great responsibility. That's why I only use user-level privileges."
  explanation: "This references the Spider-Man quote while applying it to system permissions. The joke creates humor through the cowardly avoidance of responsibility by simply refusing power, rather than wielding it responsibly."

- text: "I practice ethical hacking: I only break into systems that have really bad security. I'm doing them a favor, really."
  explanation: "This joke uses faulty moral reasoning to justify unethical behavior, creating humor through the absurd rationalization. It satirizes how people sometimes twist ethics to justify questionable actions."

- text: "Why don't AIs need ethics training? They already learned everything from the internet... wait, that's exactly why they need ethics training."
  explanation: "This joke sets up an expectation and immediately subverts it. The humor comes from the realization that the internet is actually a terrible source for learning ethics, highlighting real concerns about AI training data."

- text: "My startup's motto: 'Move fast and break things.' The ethics board suggested we add 'but not laws or trust.'"
  explanation: "This satirizes Facebook's famous motto by pointing out what gets broken when you move too fast. The humor comes from the contrast between Silicon Valley's disruption culture and actual ethical responsibility."

- text: "I wrote a program to automate my job. Then I had an existential crisis about whether I should tell my boss. Then I wrote a program to decide that too."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through recursive absurdity—using automation to solve the ethical dilemma created by automation. It touches on job displacement ethics while highlighting the programmer's tendency to solve everything with code."

- text: "The three laws of robotics are great, but have you tried implementing them with legacy code?"
  explanation: "This references Asimov's famous laws while bringing in the reality of working with old, messy codebases. The humor comes from the incongruity between idealistic ethical frameworks and the practical nightmare of real-world implementation."

- text: "Why did the data scientist refuse to bias the algorithm? Because he already had enough bias in his training data."
  explanation: "This joke layers multiple meanings: bias in machine learning, bias in training data, and human cognitive bias. The dark humor comes from acknowledging that bias is often baked in from the start, making individual ethical choices almost moot."

- text: "I believe in the right to be forgotten. That's why I write self-deleting code. Unfortunately, it deletes itself before I finish debugging."
  explanation: "This applies the GDPR 'right to be forgotten' concept to code itself, creating an absurd scenario where code literally forgets itself. The humor comes from taking a data privacy concept too literally and facing the consequences."

- text: "A programmer's guide to ethics: If you have to ask 'Is this legal?'—you're already asking the wrong question. The right question is 'Can I get caught?'... Wait, no, I mean 'Is this right?'"
  explanation: "This joke uses a false start and self-correction to create humor. It acknowledges the temptation to think about legality and consequences before morality, then catches itself, revealing the internal ethical struggle many face."

- text: "They told me to consider the ethical implications before deploying the AI. So I asked the AI. It said it was fine. Problem solved!"
  explanation: "This creates humor through circular logic and abdication of responsibility. The absurdity of asking an AI to judge its own ethics highlights real concerns about who decides what's ethical in AI development, while satirizing lazy ethical reasoning."

- text: "I finally achieved work-life balance: I feel equally guilty about neglecting both. Also, my fitness tracker's data is now being sold to insurance companies, and my smart home is testifying against me in court. But at least I automated my apology emails."
  explanation: "This joke packs multiple layers of digital ethics issues into one escalating scenario: data privacy, surveillance capitalism, IoT security risks, and automation of human interaction. The humor builds through accumulation and absurdity, ending with the darkly funny image of automated apologies for the mess created by other automation. It represents the ultimate endpoint of our ethical compromises in the digital age."
