- text: "My packets keep getting lost in the network. I should've used a GPS."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'lost packets' in networking (data that doesn't reach its destination) and the literal concept of something being lost and needing GPS navigation. It's a simple incongruity between technical and everyday concepts."
  rating: 4

- text: "Why did the network engineer bring a ladder to work? To reach the cloud."
  explanation: "This uses the misdirection pattern by taking the metaphorical 'cloud' in cloud computing and treating it as a literal physical cloud in the sky, creating humor through the absurdity of the literal interpretation."
  rating: 6

- text: "I told my router a joke, but it didn't laugh. Must have been a bandwidth issue."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the router and applies a technical limitation (bandwidth) to explain a human response (not laughing), creating humor through the inappropriate application of technical concepts to social situations."
  rating: 5

- text: "TCP and UDP walk into a bar. The bartender says 'I'll serve you.' TCP says 'Did you get that?' UDP doesn't care and orders anyway."
  explanation: "This joke personifies two network protocols, highlighting TCP's characteristic of requiring acknowledgment and UDP's characteristic of not caring about delivery confirmation, using the familiar 'walk into a bar' joke format."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't network packets ever get lonely? Because they travel in frames."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay on 'frames' which in networking refers to data encapsulation, but also suggests companionship or groups, creating a double meaning that resolves the setup question."
  rating: 5

- text: "My Wi-Fi password is 'incorrectpassword' so when someone asks for it, I can say 'incorrectpassword' and watch them struggle."
  explanation: "This creates humor through a meta-level misdirection where the literal password creates confusion when communicated, playing on the common experience of password errors and the ambiguity of language."
  rating: 7

- text: "How does a network engineer break up with their partner? They say 'I think we need to terminate this connection.'"
  explanation: "This applies networking terminology ('terminate connection') to a personal relationship, creating humor through the inappropriately technical and cold language used for an emotional situation."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to catch fog yesterday. Mist. I tried to catch network packets yesterday. Dropped."
  explanation: "This joke parallels a classic pun format with networking terminology, where 'dropped packets' (lost data) mirrors 'mist' (missed), creating a technical variant of a familiar joke structure."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the switch go to therapy? It had too many VLAN identity issues."
  explanation: "This personifies a network switch and applies the technical concept of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to psychological identity issues, creating humor through the absurd comparison between technical configuration and mental health."
  rating: 7

- text: "A network engineer's favorite pickup line: 'Are you a firewall? Because you're blocking all my incoming connections.'"
  explanation: "This transforms a technical obstacle (firewall blocking connections) into a romantic rejection scenario, creating humor through the awkward application of networking concepts to dating."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why do network engineers make terrible comedians? Their jokes always timeout before the punchline arrives."
  explanation: "This meta-joke applies the networking concept of timeouts (when connections fail due to delayed responses) to joke delivery, creating self-referential humor about technical communication failures."
  rating: 8

- text: "I named my Wi-Fi 'Hidden Network' so people would think it's hidden, but it's actually broadcasting. I'm a social engineer now."
  explanation: "This plays on both technical deception (misleading network names) and the security concept of social engineering, creating humor through the inflated self-importance of a simple prank."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's a network administrator's favorite dance? The subnet shuffle—constantly moving hosts between networks."
  explanation: "This creates an imaginary dance based on the technical task of subnet management, with 'shuffle' working both as a dance move and the act of reorganizing network addresses."
  rating: 5

- text: "My ISP said I'd get fiber optic speeds. Turns out they meant the speed of eating fiber—painfully slow and irregular."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'fiber' (fiber optic cables vs. dietary fiber) to create a comparison between promised internet speeds and disappointing reality, with an unexpected and slightly crude comparison."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the network cable break up with the wireless signal? It said 'You're too unstable, I need a more solid connection.'"
  explanation: "This personifies different network connection types and applies their technical characteristics (cable stability vs. wireless variability) to relationship dynamics, creating humor through the technical accuracy of the metaphor."
  rating: 7

- text: "A broadcast storm walks into every bar in town simultaneously. The bartenders all crash."
  explanation: "This cleverly adapts the 'walks into a bar' format to explain a broadcast storm (network packets flooding all ports), with 'crash' working as both bartender exhaustion and system failure."
  rating: 9

- text: "I tried to explain OSI layers to my date. By layer 3, she had already routed herself to another table."
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of Layer 3 routing to a dating scenario, where the date literally 'routes' herself away, creating humor through the perfect alignment of technical timing and social disaster."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't network engineers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including packet loss."
  explanation: "This takes a classic science joke and adds a networking twist, where the distrust extends to packet loss, creating a layered joke that works on multiple levels with the technical addition."
  rating: 6

- text: "My network topology is like my relationships: it started as a star, became a mesh of complications, and now it's just a bus that nobody wants to ride."
  explanation: "This extended metaphor maps three network topologies (star, mesh, bus) onto relationship progression, creating humor through the perfect parallel between technical evolution and romantic decline, with each topology representing a deteriorating state."
  rating: 9

- text: "A packet walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender says 'Sorry, we only serve streams here.' The packet replies 'That's fine, I brought 65,535 of my friends.'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke references TCP/IP concepts where packets make up streams, with the punchline revealing the maximum port number (65,535), creating humor through the escalation from one packet to the maximum possible connections."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the network engineer die alone? Because every time someone tried to connect, he responded with 'Connection refused' due to trust issues from too many SYN floods in his past."
  explanation: "This dark but technically rich joke uses the TCP handshake process (SYN packets) and the 'Connection refused' error to create a tragic metaphor about emotional damage from past attacks (SYN flood attacks), perfectly merging technical accuracy with human psychology in an unexpectedly poignant way."
