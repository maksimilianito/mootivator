```yaml
- text: "My network topology looks like a star, but performs like a bus collision."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the incongruity between network topology types—star topology should have centralized, efficient communication, but the performance resembles a bus topology experiencing constant collisions where devices compete for bandwidth."

- text: "Why did the packet go to therapy? It had too many hops and couldn't find its way home."
  explanation: "A simple setup-punchline joke using the double meaning of 'hops' (network routing steps) and the emotional concept of being lost, anthropomorphizing network packets experiencing routing issues."

- text: "I told my router a joke, but it didn't laugh. Must have been a broadcast storm."
  explanation: "This combines the concept of broadcast storms (network flooding with unnecessary traffic) with the idea that the joke 'flooded' without getting a response, creating incongruity between technical failure and social awkwardness."

- text: "TCP and UDP walked into a bar. Only TCP waited to be acknowledged."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the fundamental difference between TCP's connection-oriented, acknowledgment-based protocol and UDP's connectionless, fire-and-forget approach through a social situation."

- text: "My Wi-Fi password is 'incorrect' so when someone fails to connect, it says 'Your password is incorrect.'"
  explanation: "A misdirection joke that creates a recursive loop of confusion—the error message literally tells the truth while appearing to be an error, playing with language and user interface expectations."

- text: "Why don't network engineers ever get lost? Because they always follow the route tables."
  explanation: "A straightforward pun on 'route' (network path) and 'route' (directions for travel), applying technical networking concepts to everyday navigation."

- text: "I tried to ping my soulmate, but got 'Destination Host Unreachable.'"
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of failed network connectivity (ping failure) to romantic relationships, creating humor through the incongruity of treating love like a network connection test."

- text: "The OSI model has seven layers. My network documentation has zero."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke about the common problem of poor documentation in IT, contrasting the well-defined seven-layer OSI model with the reality of missing network documentation."

- text: "Why did the switch feel lonely? All its ports were in isolation mode."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes network hardware, using the technical concept of port isolation (security feature preventing communication between ports) to create an emotional narrative about loneliness."

- text: "My network is like my love life: full of latency and occasional packet loss."
  explanation: "A comparison joke that applies network performance problems (latency and packet loss) to personal relationships, using technical metrics to describe emotional disappointment."

- text: "I configured a mesh network at home. Now my devices have better relationships than I do."
  explanation: "This creates superiority humor (self-deprecating) by suggesting that the highly interconnected mesh topology provides better communication between devices than the person has in their social life."

- text: "Why did the network administrator break up with DNS? Too many unresolved issues."
  explanation: "A double-meaning joke playing on 'unresolved' as both a DNS failure (inability to resolve domain names) and relationship problems that remain unsolved."

- text: "Subnet masks are like my boundaries—I keep them at 255.255.255.0 but everyone still finds a way through."
  explanation: "This applies the technical concept of subnet masking (network segmentation) to personal boundaries, with the humor arising from the failure of both to keep unwanted traffic out."

- text: "I explained network topology to my date. She said our relationship was point-to-point. Then she disconnected."
  explanation: "A story-format joke that uses network topology terminology (point-to-point connection) to describe a relationship, ending with the abrupt termination mirroring a dropped connection."

- text: "Why do network packets make terrible comedians? Their timing depends entirely on latency."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the critical importance of timing in both comedy and network performance, suggesting that variable latency ruins comedic delivery just as it ruins network performance."

- text: "My firewall rules are so strict, even I can't access my own feelings."
  explanation: "A meta-humor approach that applies network security concepts (firewall rules blocking access) to emotional availability, creating layers of meaning about both technical and personal barriers."

- text: "ARP: Asking Random People where everyone lives since 1982."
  explanation: "This reframes the Address Resolution Protocol (which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses) as a social behavior, creating humor through the incongruity of treating a technical protocol as awkward social networking."

- text: "I implemented QoS on my home network. My smart fridge now has higher priority than my work laptop. The ice maker thanks me."
  explanation: "An absurdist joke about Quality of Service prioritization going wrong, with the ridiculous outcome of kitchen appliances getting better network treatment than work equipment, ending with anthropomorphized gratitude."

- text: "Why did the network engineer refuse to play hide and seek? Because good subnetting means everyone knows exactly where you are."
  explanation: "This creates humor by applying the purpose of network subnetting (organizing and locating devices efficiently) to a children's game, showing how technical expertise ruins simple fun."

- text: "VLAN: Very Lonely And Neglected—it's not a bug, it's isolation by design."
  explanation: "A sophisticated wordplay that redefines VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) while simultaneously explaining its purpose (network isolation) and creating an emotional narrative, with the meta-reference to 'it's not a bug, it's a feature.'"

- text: "My network has 99 problems and a switch is all of them. Spanning tree protocol? More like spanning tree problem—it's been calculating for three days and we're still in a loop. I tried to explain this to management, but the meeting got dropped due to insufficient bandwidth. At this point, I'm just waiting for the whole thing to broadcast storm itself into oblivion so I can start fresh with carrier pigeons."
  explanation: "This escalating absurdist rant combines multiple network problems (switch issues, spanning tree convergence, network loops, bandwidth problems, broadcast storms) into an increasingly frustrated narrative that builds to the ridiculous conclusion of abandoning modern networking entirely for RFC 1149 (IP over Avian Carriers), creating humor through technical accuracy, relatable frustration, and absurd resolution."
