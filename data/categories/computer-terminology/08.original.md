- text: "RAM: Random Access Memory, or as I call it, 'Rarely Available Memory.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays on the acronym RAM by creating an alternative meaning that reflects the common experience of running out of memory. It uses the misdirection pattern where the technical term is reinterpreted through a user's frustration."

- text: "Why did the developer avoid using the word 'deprecated'? It made him feel old."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'deprecated' - both as a technical term for outdated code and as a feeling of being undervalued or obsolete. It's a simple setup-punchline structure that connects technical jargon to human emotions."

- text: "My boss asked me to explain 'bandwidth.' I told him I was too busy."
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates incongruity by using the concept of bandwidth (capacity to handle data) as a metaphor for personal capacity, while the punchline itself demonstrates the lack of bandwidth being described."

- text: "CAPTCHA: Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. Or as humans call it: 'Can't Actually Pass This Cursed Horrible Annoyance.'"
  explanation: "This joke takes a complex acronym and creates an alternative expansion that reflects user frustration. It uses the superiority theory by allowing humans to vent about a system designed to verify their humanity."

- text: "A junior developer asks, 'What's the difference between Java and JavaScript?' The senior replies, 'About the same as the difference between car and carpet.'"
  explanation: "This classic joke addresses one of the most confusing naming conventions in programming. It uses analogy to highlight how two similarly named things can be completely unrelated, playing on the frustration of misleading terminology."

- text: "I finally understand 'asynchronous' - it means my code finishes whenever it feels like it."
  explanation: "This joke simplifies a complex technical concept through humorous oversimplification. It uses the relief theory by expressing the common frustration of dealing with asynchronous programming in a relatable way."

- text: "RTFM used to mean 'Read The Fine Manual.' Now it means 'Read The Five-Thousand-Page Manual Nobody Actually Reads.'"
  explanation: "This joke plays with the evolution of a famous acronym while commenting on documentation bloat. It uses exaggeration to highlight the absurdity of modern technical documentation."

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite type of tree? A binary tree - because it only has two possible outcomes: it works or it doesn't."
  explanation: "This joke combines a technical data structure term with a reductionist view of programming success. It uses the absurdity technique by oversimplifying the complex nature of debugging."

- text: "I told my manager I needed to 'refactor' my code. He thought I meant I was going to the factory."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the communication gap between technical and non-technical people through a simple misunderstanding of jargon. It uses the incongruity pattern where technical terminology is misinterpreted literally."

- text: "Why do programmers confuse Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25."
  explanation: "This is a classic joke playing on numeral systems - octal 31 equals decimal 25. It requires knowledge of different base systems, making it accessible to those familiar with computer science fundamentals while being clever wordplay."

- text: "A user reported a bug as 'critical.' Turns out 'critical' means 'I don't like the button color.'"
  explanation: "This joke addresses the disconnect between technical terminology and user interpretation. It uses the superiority theory by allowing technical people to feel knowing about the misuse of severity classifications."

- text: "My code has 'technical debt.' My manager heard 'technical' and assumed it was a good thing."
  explanation: "This joke plays on how adding 'technical' to a term can make it sound sophisticated to non-technical managers, even when describing something negative. It uses irony to highlight communication gaps."

- text: "What's the difference between 'fatal error' and 'critical error'? Fatal error: your program dies. Critical error: your career dies."
  explanation: "This joke escalates the severity of technical terms by applying them to real-world consequences. It uses the incongruity pattern by shifting from technical to personal impact."

- text: "I love 'backward compatibility' - it means my code from 2010 still doesn't work, just like it didn't back then."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the positive connotation of 'backward compatibility' by suggesting consistency in failure rather than success. It uses dark humor and the relief theory to cope with legacy code frustrations."

- text: "A developer's guide to terminology: 'Scalable' means it works on my laptop. 'Enterprise-ready' means it crashes consistently across all platforms."
  explanation: "This joke satirizes marketing jargon by providing cynical definitions that reflect developer experiences. It uses the superiority theory by exposing the gap between buzzwords and reality."

- text: "Why did the API documentation say 'self-explanatory'? Because the writer couldn't explain it either."
  explanation: "This joke highlights a common frustration with poor documentation by suggesting that 'self-explanatory' is code for 'we gave up.' It uses the relief theory to address a universal developer pain point."

- text: "What's 'idempotent' mean? It means you can ask me what it means multiple times and I'll still have no idea."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses the actual definition of idempotency (producing the same result when repeated) to make a joke about not understanding the term. It's self-referential humor that works on multiple levels."

- text: "The best part about 'loosely typed' languages? You're free to make mistakes in creative new ways."
  explanation: "This joke takes a technical feature description and reframes it as a liability. It uses irony to comment on the double-edged nature of language design choices."

- text: "I asked what 'BLOB' meant. They said 'Binary Large Object.' I said, 'So... a file?' They stopped talking to me."
  explanation: "This joke mocks how technical jargon can overcomplicate simple concepts. It uses the absurdity technique to highlight how fancy terminology sometimes obscures rather than clarifies."

- text: "Why do we call it 'garbage collection' when the garbage is still in production?"
  explanation: "This is sophisticated wordplay that works on two levels: the technical meaning of memory management and the quality of production code. It uses the paradox method to create humor from the contradiction."

- text: "A programmer's definition of 'intuitive': 'Works exactly the way I think it should, and everyone else is wrong.'"
  explanation: "This joke exposes the subjective nature of supposedly objective technical terms. It uses meta-humor to comment on how technical discussions often mask personal preferences as universal truths, while also highlighting programmer ego in a self-aware way."
