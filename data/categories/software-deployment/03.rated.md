- text: "Our deployment script works perfectly... in the README."
  explanation: This joke uses irony and the common experience where documentation describes an ideal process that doesn't match reality. The humor comes from the gap between what's documented and what actually functions.

- text: "Why did the developer push to production on Friday? They didn't."
  explanation: This subverts expectations by setting up a question that implies someone made this notorious mistake, then delivers the punchline that no rational developer would actually do this. It plays on the well-known taboo of Friday deployments.

- text: "My CI/CD pipeline is so fast, it deploys bugs before I even write them."
  explanation: This uses absurdist exaggeration and temporal impossibility to highlight the anxiety around automated deployments potentially pushing problems to production quickly.
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between production and staging? About 3 hours of panic."
  explanation: This misdirection joke sets up expecting a technical answer but delivers an emotional truth about the stress when production inevitably differs from staging environments.
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production."
  explanation: This parodies the famous "Most Interesting Man in the World" meme while highlighting the risky (but sometimes real) practice of testing in live environments. The humor comes from admitting a taboo practice.
  rating: 9

- text: "Our rollback strategy is a prayer and a git revert."
  explanation: This combines religious imagery with technical terminology to emphasize how unprepared teams often are for deployment failures, finding humor in the inadequacy of disaster recovery plans.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do DevOps engineers make terrible magicians? Because everyone sees exactly when their tricks fail."
  explanation: This uses the metaphor of magic to describe deployments, with the punchline highlighting how visible and public deployment failures are, unlike a magician's controlled environment.

- text: "Deployed to production. Everything works. I don't trust it."
  explanation: This three-part progression captures the paranoia developers feel when deployments go smoothly, using the unexpected reaction of suspicion rather than relief as the source of humor.
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a deployment engineer's favorite exercise? Rolling back."
  explanation: This uses double meaning wordplay, where "rolling back" refers both to a physical exercise motion and the technical process of reverting a bad deployment.
  rating: 5

- text: "My deployment process has three environments: development, staging, and oh-god-what-have-I-done."
  explanation: This lists two standard environments then subverts expectations with an emotional state as the third environment, capturing the panic of production issues.
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the deployment fail? Because success would be off-brand for us."
  explanation: This self-deprecating joke uses the concept of "branding" applied to chronic deployment problems, finding humor in accepting failure as an identity.
  rating: 7

- text: "I've achieved continuous deployment. My code continuously deploys bugs."
  explanation: This uses the technical term "continuous deployment" but twists it to mean continuously deploying problems rather than continuously delivering value, playing on the gap between CI/CD ideals and reality.
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know a deployment went well? You don't get any Slack messages for 10 minutes."
  explanation: This captures the anxious waiting period after deployment where silence is golden, and the absence of communication becomes the metric for success.
  rating: 10

- text: "Our blue-green deployment strategy: blue when it's working, green when we're nauseous from stress."
  explanation: This redefines the technical terms "blue-green deployment" to refer to emotional and physical states rather than server configurations, using color symbolism humorously.
  rating: 7

- text: "A developer walks into a bar. The staging bar. The production bar was down."
  explanation: This uses the classic "walks into a bar" joke format but makes it about environment availability, with the punchline revealing production is unavailable while staging works—the opposite of priorities.
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do deployment pipelines have so many stages? So you can fail in more interesting ways."
  explanation: This cynically reframes the purpose of multi-stage pipelines from quality assurance to variety in failure modes, finding humor in the inevitability of problems.
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my boss I'd automate deployments. Now I automatically panic at 3 AM."
  explanation: This plays on the word "automate" by showing that automation doesn't eliminate problems, it just schedules them for inconvenient times, with the added humor of literal interpretation.
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a deployment and a disaster? About 30 seconds and a missing rollback plan."
  explanation: This joke uses minimal difference to show how quickly success can become catastrophe, with the technical detail of the missing rollback plan making it specific and relatable.
  rating: 8

- text: "My code passed all tests in development, staging, and pre-production. Production said 'hold my beer.'"
  explanation: This uses the "hold my beer" meme to personify production as recklessly confident it can break what all other environments approved, capturing how production always finds new ways to fail.
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the DevOps engineer go to therapy? They had too many unresolved merge conflicts in their deployment strategy."
  explanation: This applies the technical term "merge conflicts" metaphorically to psychological issues, creating a layered joke about both technical and emotional struggles in deployment processes.
  rating: 6

- text: "I've mastered zero-downtime deployments. Zero downtime, infinite anxiety, and a terminal window I'm afraid to close because I don't know which process is keeping production alive."
  explanation: This extended joke subverts the ideal of "zero-downtime" by showing that while technically achieved, it comes at the cost of psychological downtime and fragile, mysterious infrastructure that nobody dares touch—a perfect encapsulation of modern deployment fears.
