- text: "I tried to automate my system maintenance, but now I maintain the automation scripts."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and the incongruity theory - the attempt to reduce work through automation actually creates new maintenance work, highlighting a common paradox in IT where solutions create their own problems."

- text: "Why did the server go to therapy? It had too many unresolved dependencies."
  explanation: "A simple setup-punchline joke using wordplay on 'unresolved' - both a technical term for package management issues and a psychological term for emotional problems."

- text: "My backup strategy is like my diet - I'll start it tomorrow."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory through self-deprecation, comparing two common procrastination scenarios that most people can relate to, making the technical concept more accessible."

- text: "The three stages of system maintenance: 1) It works, 2) It still works but I don't know why, 3) Call the person who left six months ago."
  explanation: "This joke uses the pattern of escalating absurdity combined with the relief theory, acknowledging the common anxiety of maintaining legacy systems and the loss of institutional knowledge."

- text: "I don't always test my disaster recovery plan, but when I do, it's during an actual disaster."
  explanation: "A misdirection joke using the 'Most Interesting Man' meme format, highlighting the dangerous reality that many organizations only discover their backup failures when it's too late."

- text: "Why do system administrators prefer dark mode? Because their monitoring dashboards are already full of red lights."
  explanation: "This combines double meaning (dark mode as UI preference and the dark reality of system failures) with the incongruity of turning something negative into a preference."

- text: "My server uptime is like my attention span - impressive until someone asks me to prove it."
  explanation: "Uses comparison humor and self-deprecation, playing on the gap between claimed metrics and actual documentation, a common issue in IT maintenance."

- text: "I've achieved 99.9% uptime! The other 0.1% was during business hours."
  explanation: "This joke uses timing irony - technically meeting the metric while failing in the most critical moment, highlighting how statistics can be misleading."

- text: "What's the difference between a system administrator and a fortune teller? The fortune teller doesn't know when the server will crash."
  explanation: "A comparison joke using superiority theory, suggesting sysadmins have prophetic knowledge of impending failures from experience and pattern recognition."

- text: "Preventive maintenance is what you do the day after something breaks."
  explanation: "A short, punchy aphorism using temporal irony - the 'preventive' action comes too late, satirizing reactive rather than proactive IT management."

- text: "I told my boss we need redundancy. Now I have two bosses telling me the same thing."
  explanation: "This uses misdirection and double meaning of 'redundancy' - both technical failover systems and organizational duplication, with an unexpected twist on workplace dynamics."

- text: "Why did the hard drive go to the gym? It wanted to avoid a crash by staying in shape."
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke using anthropomorphization and the double meaning of 'crash' and 'staying in shape' applied to hardware maintenance."

- text: "My monitoring system is so good, it alerts me about problems I didn't know I had, at times I didn't want to know about them."
  explanation: "This uses escalating absurdity to highlight the love-hate relationship with monitoring tools - they're helpful but can create alert fatigue and stress."

- text: "The server room temperature is perfect - exactly halfway between 'arctic' and 'data center on fire.'"
  explanation: "Uses exaggeration and binary extremes to satirize the critical but often neglected aspect of environmental monitoring in maintenance."

- text: "I practice defensive programming. My code is so defensive, it refuses to run in production."
  explanation: "This joke employs personification and takes the concept of 'defensive' to an absurd extreme, reflecting the tension between caution and functionality."

- text: "Why don't servers ever retire? Because every time they try, someone finds one more critical legacy system running on them."
  explanation: "A longer narrative joke using the incongruity between planned obsolescence and reality, highlighting the common problem of technical debt and dependency chains."

- text: "My patch management strategy is like a game of Jenga - remove the wrong piece and everything falls apart."
  explanation: "Uses metaphor and the relief theory, acknowledging the anxiety of system updates where dependencies are unclear and risks are high."

- text: "What did the sysadmin say after successfully updating 500 servers without incident? 'I must have forgotten something.'"
  explanation: "This joke uses dramatic irony and the psychology of IT work - success feels suspicious because failures are more common, reflecting learned paranoia from experience."

- text: "I've mastered the art of predictive maintenance. I can predict with 100% accuracy that if I don't maintain it, it will break."
  explanation: "A meta-humor joke that plays with the concept of 'predictive' by reducing it to a tautology, satirizing obvious truths presented as insights."

- text: "The best time to start maintaining your system was five years ago. The second best time is right after it crashes in front of the CEO."
  explanation: "This parodies the famous tree-planting proverb with dark humor, using timing irony and the specific horror scenario of public failure to create maximum comedic impact."

- text: "My documentation is so thorough that future me will understand exactly how past me had no idea what I was doing, but somehow kept everything running anyway."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses recursive self-reference and temporal paradox, celebrating the chaotic reality of system maintenance where things work despite, not because of, our understanding - the ultimate meta-commentary on IT survival skills."
