- text: "Theoretically, my algorithm runs in O(1) time. Practically, it runs in O(please-work) time."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the gap between theoretical complexity analysis and real-world implementation, contrasting formal Big O notation with the desperate hope that code will actually execute."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the Turing machine go to therapy? It couldn't decide if it would halt."
  explanation: "A reference to the halting problem, one of computer science's fundamental undecidable problems, personified as an existential crisis for the theoretical computing model."
  rating: 7

- text: "I told my friend I was studying NP-complete problems. He asked if I'd solved any. I said 'I don't know, but if I had, I'd know I had.'"
  explanation: "This jokes about the P vs NP problem - if you can verify a solution quickly (NP), but finding it is hard. The circular logic mirrors the complexity class definitions."
  rating: 9

- text: "My professor said my algorithm was polynomial time. I said 'which polynomial?' He said 'all of them.'"
  explanation: "Plays on the fact that O(n^1000) is technically polynomial but completely impractical, highlighting the gap between theoretical classification and usefulness."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't graph theorists ever get lost? Because they always find a path, even if it's not the shortest one."
  explanation: "References graph traversal algorithms and the difference between finding any solution versus finding an optimal one, a key distinction in algorithm design."
  rating: 6

- text: "I implemented a quantum algorithm on my classical computer. It's in a superposition of working and crashing."
  explanation: "Mocks the impossibility of running quantum algorithms on classical hardware by applying quantum mechanics terminology (superposition) to software states."
  rating: 7

- text: "Recursion: noun. See recursion."
  explanation: "A classic self-referential joke that demonstrates recursion by being recursive itself, using the format of a dictionary definition for meta-humor effect."
  rating: 5

- text: "Why did the computer scientist plant a tree? To study its O(log n) growth rate."
  explanation: "Plays on binary trees in computer science and their logarithmic height, applying algorithm analysis to actual botanical growth in an absurd way."
  rating: 6

- text: "My thesis proves that P=NP. Unfortunately, the proof itself is NP-hard to verify."
  explanation: "A paradoxical joke about the most famous unsolved problem in computer science, where the solution's difficulty mirrors the problem it claims to solve."
  rating: 9

- text: "I wrote a sorting algorithm that runs in O(1) time. It just declares the array already sorted."
  explanation: "Satirizes the difference between actually solving a problem and merely changing the problem definition, a common temptation in algorithm design."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the complexity theorist break up with the algorithm designer? Too many worst-case scenarios."
  explanation: "Uses relationship metaphor to contrast theoretical worst-case analysis with practical average-case performance, highlighting different perspectives in CS."
  rating: 7

- text: "A finite automaton walks into a bar. The bartender says 'What state are you in?' It says 'Yes.'"
  explanation: "Plays on automata theory where machines exist in specific states, and the double meaning of 'state' (condition vs. formal state in computation)."
  rating: 7

- text: "I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes 3 days to run. Turns out n = 10^15."
  explanation: "Highlights how theoretical improvements can be meaningless when constants and actual input sizes make everything impractical, a reality check on Big O notation."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do theoretical computer scientists love the beach? Because they can work on infinite sand."
  explanation: "A pun combining 'infinite sand' with 'infinite automata/state machines,' playing on the theoretical nature of working with infinite computational models."
  rating: 5

- text: "My code has O(1) space complexity. It stores everything in the variable name."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that technically satisfies space complexity requirements through an obviously impractical loophole, mocking overly literal interpretations of theory."
  rating: 8

- text: "A programmer's spouse asks: 'Would you love me if I were O(n²)?' The programmer responds: 'Honey, my love for you is O(1) - constant and independent of input size.'"
  explanation: "Romantic use of complexity notation where constant-time love is actually the most desirable, inverting the usual preference for lower complexity."
  rating: 7

- text: "I proved my algorithm correct using induction. Base case: it works for n=0. Inductive step: I assume it works. QED."
  explanation: "Satirizes mathematical proof by induction by skipping the crucial inductive step, highlighting how proofs can be hand-waved in practice."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the lambda calculus expression go to the gym? To reduce its beta."
  explanation: "Sophisticated wordplay on beta reduction in lambda calculus (a fundamental operation) and reducing body fat, requiring knowledge of theoretical CS foundations."
  rating: 6

- text: "My dating life is like the halting problem: theoretically interesting, but I can't prove it will ever terminate successfully."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor applying one of CS theory's most famous undecidable problems to personal life, with layered meaning about unprovability and uncertainty."
  rating: 8

- text: "A logician's child asks: 'Can I have ice cream?' The logician says: 'Yes.' The child sits there. The logician sighs: 'That wasn't an imperative, it was a Boolean response to your query about permission states.'"
  explanation: "Brilliant demonstration of the difference between formal logic and natural language pragmatics, showing how theoretical precision fails in human communication."
  rating: 10

- text: "I finally understood Church-Turing thesis when I realized my ability to procrastinate is Turing-complete: given enough time, I can avoid any computable task."
  explanation: "Masterfully applies the fundamental equivalence of computational models to human behavior, suggesting procrastination has the same theoretical power as universal computation."
