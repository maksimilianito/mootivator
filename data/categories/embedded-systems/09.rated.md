- text: "My embedded system's documentation says 'low power mode' but my electricity bill disagrees."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony between marketing claims of energy efficiency in embedded systems and the reality of power consumption, using simple observational humor to highlight the gap between specification and real-world performance."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the microcontroller go to therapy? It had too many unresolved interrupts."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning pattern, where 'unresolved interrupts' refers both to the technical concept of interrupt handling in embedded systems and the psychological concept of unresolved issues, creating humor through the anthropomorphization of hardware."
  rating: 7

- text: "IoT stands for 'Internet of Things,' but in my experience it's more like 'Internet of Troubles.'"
  explanation: "A simple wordplay joke that maintains the same acronym structure while reframing the meaning to reflect the common frustrations developers face with IoT device reliability and connectivity issues."
  rating: 5

- text: "My smart fridge is so smart it forgot it was supposed to keep food cold."
  explanation: "This joke uses irony and the incongruity theory, where the 'intelligence' of a smart device paradoxically leads to failure at its basic function, commenting on feature creep in embedded systems."
  rating: 7

- text: "In embedded systems, 'real-time' means 'right now' to the user but 'good luck with that deadline' to the developer."
  explanation: "This highlights the gap between user expectations and technical reality in real-time embedded systems, using the misdirection pattern where the same term has drastically different implications for different stakeholders."
  rating: 8

- text: "I optimized my code so much for memory that now I can't remember what it does."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke using the double meaning of 'memory' (both RAM and human memory), reflecting the extreme resource constraints in embedded development that can lead to unreadable, over-optimized code."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't embedded programmers trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including their stack overflow."
  explanation: "This combines a classic science joke setup with embedded systems terminology, where 'stack overflow' becomes the punchline that ties the atomic reference to a common embedded programming error."
  rating: 6

- text: "My microcontroller has 2KB of RAM. That's not a typo, that's my entire development environment."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration and the superiority theory to highlight the extreme resource constraints in embedded systems, contrasting sharply with modern development environments that consume gigabytes of memory."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote an IoT device that's so secure, even I can't access it anymore."
  explanation: "A self-deprecating joke about the challenges of implementing security in resource-constrained devices, where the security measures become so restrictive they defeat the device's usability."
  rating: 8

- text: "In embedded systems, every byte counts. Literally. I have a counter for each one."
  explanation: "This uses wordplay on 'counts' (both 'matters' and 'counting'), emphasizing the obsessive attention to memory usage in embedded development while creating humor through the absurd image of literally counting bytes."
  rating: 7

- text: "My Arduino project has three states: not working, working mysteriously, and on fire."
  explanation: "This joke uses the rule of three pattern to escalate the states of an embedded project, with the final state being absurdly literal, reflecting the unpredictable nature of hardware debugging."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the embedded developer break up with their partner? They said 'It's not you, it's my watchdog timer.'"
  explanation: "This applies embedded systems terminology (watchdog timer, which resets systems that hang) to a relationship context, creating humor through the unexpected technical excuse for a breakup."
  rating: 7

- text: "I tried to teach my microcontroller machine learning, but with 4KB of RAM, it can barely learn its own name."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the absurdity of running modern AI algorithms on resource-constrained embedded systems, using anthropomorphization and exaggeration to emphasize the memory limitations."
  rating: 8

- text: "The three lies of embedded systems: 'It'll only take 5 minutes to flash,' 'This will definitely fit in ROM,' and 'We don't need a debugger.'"
  explanation: "Using the classic 'three lies' format, this joke catalogs common optimistic assumptions in embedded development that inevitably prove false, resonating with developers' shared experiences."
  rating: 8

- text: "My IoT device is so connected it has better social skills than I do, but worse security."
  explanation: "This joke uses comparison humor and self-deprecation to comment on the paradox of IoT devices: they're designed for connectivity but often lack proper security implementation, making them vulnerable despite their 'social' nature."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do embedded programmers love bit shifting? Because malloc is a luxury they can't afford."
  explanation: "This joke contrasts low-level bit manipulation techniques with dynamic memory allocation, highlighting how embedded developers must use primitive operations because standard memory management functions consume too many resources."
  rating: 8

- text: "I spent three days debugging my embedded system. Turns out I forgot to connect the ground wire. The universe is held together by ground wires and spite."
  explanation: "This combines a common hardware debugging story with an absurdist philosophical conclusion, using escalation to create humor while reflecting the frustration of simple mistakes causing complex problems."
  rating: 9

- text: "In embedded systems, 'undefined behavior' isn't a bug, it's a feature we haven't documented yet because we ran out of flash memory."
  explanation: "This inverts the classic 'it's a feature, not a bug' excuse while adding the embedded-specific constraint of limited storage, creating layered humor about both code quality and resource limitations."
  rating: 8

- text: "My smart thermostat has a PhD in making my house the wrong temperature at the worst possible time."
  explanation: "This uses hyperbolic anthropomorphization to suggest the device is intelligently malicious rather than simply poorly programmed, commenting on the gap between 'smart' device promises and reality."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the RTOS task go to anger management? It had priority inversion issues and kept getting blocked by lower-class tasks."
  explanation: "This joke transforms a complex embedded systems concept (priority inversion in Real-Time Operating Systems) into a therapy scenario, where technical problems become psychological issues, creating humor through unexpected contextualization."
  rating: 7

- text: "I finally achieved 100% code coverage on my embedded system. Turns out when you only have 512 bytes of program memory, testing everything is pretty quick. Now I have 0 bytes left for the actual product features, but at least it's well-tested nothingness."
  explanation: "This is a multi-layered joke that starts with an achievement (complete test coverage), reveals the resource constraint that makes it trivial, then escalates to the absurd conclusion that perfect testing came at the cost of all functionality, satirizing the balance between quality assurance and practical development in severely resource-constrained environments."
