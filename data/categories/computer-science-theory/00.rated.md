- text: "I tried to prove P=NP, but my proof had O(n!) complexity."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the irony that attempting to solve the most famous computational complexity problem resulted in creating an algorithm with factorial time complexity, which is one of the worst possible complexities. The humor comes from the self-defeating nature of the attempt."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the Turing machine go to therapy? It couldn't decide if it would halt."
  explanation: "This references the famous Halting Problem, which states that you cannot create an algorithm that determines whether any given program will halt or run forever. The joke anthropomorphizes this undecidable problem as an existential crisis."
  rating: 8

- text: "My algorithm is so efficient, it completes before it starts. Unfortunately, that violates causality."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke plays with the concept of algorithmic efficiency taken to an impossible extreme, creating a humorous paradox where optimization breaks the laws of physics."
  rating: 6

- text: "How do you comfort a computer scientist? Tell them their problem is NP-complete, so nobody expects them to solve it anyway."
  explanation: "This joke provides relief through the superiority theory - finding comfort in the fact that NP-complete problems are notoriously difficult, so failure is socially acceptable and expected."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a sorting algorithm that works in O(1) time. The trick is I only test it on already-sorted arrays."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection to mock the practice of testing algorithms only on favorable cases, highlighting the gap between theoretical performance and practical applicability."
  rating: 8

- text: "Recursion: see Recursion."
  explanation: "A classic meta-joke that demonstrates recursion by being self-referential. The humor comes from the infinite loop created by following the instruction, which perfectly illustrates the concept it's describing."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do functional programmers avoid loops? Because they prefer to let recursion stack up their problems."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'stack up' - both accumulating problems and the actual call stack used in recursion, while poking fun at functional programming's preference for recursion over iteration."
  rating: 7

- text: "A quantum computer walks into a bar. And doesn't. And does. The bartender says, 'Make up your mind!' It says, 'I did - all of them.'"
  explanation: "This joke brilliantly captures quantum superposition, where a quantum bit exists in multiple states simultaneously until observed, creating an absurd scenario that accurately reflects the counterintuitive nature of quantum computing."
  rating: 9

- text: "My thesis advisor told me to make my algorithm more elegant. So I added more Greek letters to the complexity analysis."
  explanation: "This satirizes academic culture where complex notation is sometimes confused with actual elegance or quality, playing on the incongruity between surface-level sophistication and genuine improvement."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the graph theorist break up with their partner? Too many cycles and not enough trees."
  explanation: "This uses graph theory terminology as a metaphor for relationship problems - cycles representing repeated issues and trees representing healthy, acyclic structures."
  rating: 6

- text: "I proved my algorithm correct. Then I implemented it and discovered proof by contradiction."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the gap between theoretical correctness and practical implementation, where the implementation contradicts the proof, creating ironic humor about the challenges of turning theory into practice."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a computer scientist's favorite type of tree? One with optimal height-balance and minimal emotional baggage."
  explanation: "This combines technical concepts (balanced binary trees) with human emotional concepts, creating humor through the unexpected application of data structure properties to personal relationships."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked a complexity theorist how long it would take to solve my problem. They said, 'In theory, polynomial time. In practice, heat death of the universe.'"
  explanation: "This joke exploits the gap between asymptotic complexity (which ignores constants) and real-world performance, where a polynomial algorithm with huge constants is practically useless."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't automata theorists ever finish their sentences? Because they get stuck in infiniteâ€”"
  explanation: "This joke demonstrates an infinite loop by actually becoming one, cutting off mid-sentence to illustrate the very concept it's describing, creating both structural and conceptual humor."
  rating: 9

- text: "My professor said my algorithm was 'novel.' Turns out that's academic for 'nobody else was foolish enough to try this approach.'"
  explanation: "This plays with the double meaning of 'novel' in academia - ostensibly meaning innovative, but sometimes meaning impractical or misguided, revealing the hidden meanings in academic politeness."
  rating: 7

- text: "How many computer scientists does it take to change a lightbulb? That's a hardware problem, and we don't lower ourselves to O(1) physical operations."
  explanation: "This joke mocks the theoretical/practical divide in computer science, where abstract thinkers dismiss concrete problems, while ironically calling a simple task 'O(1)' in complexity notation."
  rating: 6

- text: "I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path to success. Turns out there are negative-weight edges everywhere, so I should have used Bellman-Ford."
  explanation: "This applies graph algorithms to life metaphorically, where negative-weight edges represent setbacks, and the joke shows deep understanding by knowing which algorithm handles negative weights."
  rating: 8

- text: "A logician's spouse says, 'Go to the store and buy milk. If they have eggs, get a dozen.' The logician returns with 12 cartons of milk."
  explanation: "This classic joke exploits the difference between natural language and formal logic, where 'get a dozen' grammatically refers back to the implicit subject 'cartons' rather than switching to eggs."
  rating: 10

- text: "Why did the computational complexity theorist refuse to date? Because finding a perfect match is NP-hard, but verifying a bad one is polynomial."
  explanation: "This brilliantly applies the definition of NP-completeness to relationships - it's hard to find a good partner but easy to recognize a bad relationship, perfectly mirroring the verify-vs-solve distinction."
  rating: 9

- text: "I finally understood the Y Combinator. Then I tried to explain it to someone else and entered an infinite loop of 'Wait, so it's a function that...' until stack overflow."
  explanation: "This meta-joke about recursion and fixed-point combinators uses the actual experience of explaining recursion to demonstrate recursion, while the stack overflow punchline perfectly captures what happens when you recurse too deeply."
  rating: 8

- text: "A computer scientist is drowning, waving their arms frantically. A complexity theorist on shore shouts, 'Don't worry! I can prove that a rescue algorithm exists!' The computer scientist gurgles, 'Is it constructive or non-constructive?' Last words: 'Axiom of choice...'"
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke plays on the distinction between constructive and non-constructive proofs in mathematics, where proving something exists doesn't mean you can actually find it - a profound concept made darkly hilarious through its application to a life-or-death situation, with the final reference to the axiom of choice being the perfect absurdist touch."
