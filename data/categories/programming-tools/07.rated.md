- text: "My IDE autocomplete suggested 'break;' during my relationship argument."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity by applying programming autocomplete functionality to a personal situation. The word 'break' has dual meaning - ending a loop in programming and ending a relationship, creating wordplay that programmers will immediately recognize."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer switch to Vim? He wanted to quit but couldn't figure out how."
  explanation: "This references the infamous difficulty of exiting Vim editor (`:q`), a universal frustration for new users. The setup-punchline structure plays on the expectation that switching editors is about features, but the punchline reveals he's now trapped."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code editor has dark mode. My future has darker mode."
  explanation: "This uses parallel structure and escalation humor, comparing the popular dark mode feature with programmer pessimism about career prospects or project deadlines. The wordplay on 'darker' creates a self-deprecating tone."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's an IDE's favorite exercise? Tab-ata training."
  explanation: "A pun combining 'Tab' (the indentation key) with 'Tabata' (a workout method). This simple wordplay creates humor through the absurdity of personifying an IDE and the unexpected fitness reference."
  rating: 5

- text: "I told my IDE I needed space. It gave me 127 syntax errors."
  explanation: "Double meaning of 'space' - personal space in relationships versus whitespace in code. The specific number adds authenticity, and the incongruity of treating an IDE like a relationship partner creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do programmers love VSCode? Because even their editor has commitment issues with extensions."
  explanation: "This plays on VSCode's extensive extension ecosystem and occasional compatibility problems, anthropomorphizing the editor with 'commitment issues' - a human relationship problem applied to software behavior."
  rating: 6

- text: "My text editor crashed. I guess it couldn't handle my emotional comments."
  explanation: "Combines the technical concept of software crashes with the idea of emotional code comments. The misdirection suggests the comments were so emotionally charged they overwhelmed the system."
  rating: 6

- text: "Debugging in Notepad is just coding with trust issues and no safety net."
  explanation: "This uses metaphor to describe the lack of IDE features (syntax highlighting, debugging tools) as psychological problems. The 'trust issues' personification creates relatable humor about tool dependency."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the programmer break up with their IDE? Too many pop-ups asking 'Are you sure?'"
  explanation: "Transforms the annoying confirmation dialogs into relationship nagging. The setup-punchline structure works because every developer has experienced dialog fatigue, making the relationship metaphor land perfectly."
  rating: 8

- text: "My IDE suggested I refactor my life choices."
  explanation: "Brief and punchy, this applies the technical concept of refactoring (improving code structure) to personal life decisions. The absurdity of an IDE offering life advice creates the humor through incongruity."
  rating: 8

- text: "IntelliJ's autocomplete is so good, it finished my resignation letter before I knew I was quitting."
  explanation: "Exaggerates the powerful autocomplete feature to absurd levels, suggesting it predicts not just code but life decisions. The escalation from helpful tool to omniscient predictor creates the comedy."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call an IDE without plugins? A text editor with anxiety about its identity."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes software with psychological issues, playing on the blurry line between text editors and IDEs. The 'identity anxiety' creates humor through applying human existential crisis to software."
  rating: 7

- text: "I switched from Emacs to Vim. Now my fingers are confused and my productivity is in therapy."
  explanation: "References the famous editor wars while personifying both fingers and productivity. The escalation from physical confusion to mental health issues creates layered absurdity that programmers will appreciate."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't IDEs ever win at poker? They always show their hand with autocomplete."
  explanation: "Uses the gambling metaphor where 'showing your hand' means revealing your cards prematurely, paralleling how autocomplete reveals suggestions. The unexpected context switch creates the humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code editor has more themes than my personality has moods, and both crash unexpectedly."
  explanation: "Parallel comparison between customizable editor themes and human emotional states, with the shared trait of 'crashing' tying them together. Self-deprecating humor about mental health and software stability."
  rating: 7

- text: "Eclipse is like that friend who means well but takes twenty minutes to get ready and brings their entire house with them."
  explanation: "Extended metaphor comparing Eclipse's notorious slow startup and heavy resource usage to an annoying friend. The story format and relatable situation create humor through personification and exaggeration."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer install fifty IDE extensions? Because one more couldn't possibly slow things down... narrator: it did."
  explanation: "Uses the 'narrator' device from TV shows to create dramatic irony. The self-deception about performance degradation is a universal developer experience, making the punchline hit harder."
  rating: 8

- text: "My IDE's 'Undo' has 500 steps. My life needs an 'Undo' with 500 steps. Both run out when I need them most."
  explanation: "Sophisticated parallel structure comparing technical limitations with life regrets. The shared limitation creates philosophical humor about the impossibility of fixing everything, whether in code or life."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's the difference between a junior developer and their IDE? The IDE eventually stops suggesting stupid things."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating superiority humor that subverts expectations - usually we'd expect the human to be smarter, but here the AI assistant becomes the wise one. The learning curve metaphor resonates with all developers."
  rating: 8

- text: "I asked my IDE for relationship advice. It suggested I try-catch my feelings, but I keep throwing exceptions and nobody's handling them."
  explanation: "Extended programming metaphor applying exception handling to emotions. The technical accuracy (try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions, handlers) combined with emotional vulnerability creates multi-layered humor that works both technically and emotionally."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the programmer marry their IDE? Because after 10,000 hours together, they finally understood each other's shortcuts, finished each other's functions, and when things broke, they debugged life together one breakpoint at a time."
  explanation: "This is the most sophisticated joke, using the '10,000 hour rule,' relationship milestones, and debugging metaphors. The escalation from shortcuts to functions to life debugging creates a genuinely touching yet funny narrative about the deep relationship developers have with their tools. The 'breakpoint at a time' ending provides both technical accuracy and emotional resonance."
