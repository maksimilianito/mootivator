- text: "My computer's cooling fan died. Now it's just a heating fan."
  explanation: "A simple play on the reversal of function - when a cooling fan fails, the computer overheats, making it ironically produce only heat. The humor comes from the matter-of-fact observation of a component doing the opposite of its intended purpose."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the motherboard go to therapy? It had too many connection issues."
  explanation: "This joke uses the double meaning of 'connection issues' - both the technical problem of hardware connections failing and the emotional/psychological meaning of relationship problems. The incongruity of applying human emotional problems to hardware creates the humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "I bought 32GB of RAM but forgot what I needed it for."
  explanation: "This is ironic because RAM (Random Access Memory) is used for remembering/storing data temporarily, yet the purchaser can't remember why they bought memory. The joke plays on the contradiction between the purpose of the hardware and the human's forgetfulness."
  rating: 8

- text: "My SSD is so fast, my computer finishes crashing before I realize something's wrong."
  explanation: "This uses incongruity theory by taking a positive attribute (speed) and applying it to a negative situation (crashing). The absurd exaggeration that even failures happen too fast to notice creates humor through the unexpected twist."
  rating: 7

- text: "How does a computer get drunk? It takes screenshots."
  explanation: "A pun playing on 'shots' (as in alcoholic drinks) and 'screenshots' (capturing the computer display). The anthropomorphization of the computer combined with the wordplay creates a lighthearted joke accessible to general audiences."
  rating: 5

- text: "I told my GPU it was overworked. It gave me the cold shoulder... fan."
  explanation: "This joke layers multiple meanings: the 'cold shoulder' idiom for ignoring someone, combined with the literal cold air from GPU cooling fans. It anthropomorphizes the GPU while making a technical reference to thermal management."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't hard drives ever win arguments? They always lose their sectors."
  explanation: "A play on 'losing your train of thought' or 'losing your composure' versus the technical failure of hard drives losing disk sectors. The pun on 'sectors' creates a bridge between human debate failures and hardware failures."
  rating: 6

- text: "My processor has 8 cores but still can't handle my core issues."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'core' - CPU cores for processing versus emotional/personal core issues. The superiority theory applies as it's self-deprecating humor about the computer being powerful yet unable to solve human problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "Quantum computers are amazing. They can be in a state of working and broken simultaneously until you check them."
  explanation: "This references quantum superposition (Schr√∂dinger's cat) applied to computer reliability. The humor comes from the technical accuracy of quantum mechanics combined with the universal experience of computers mysteriously working or not working."

- text: "I upgraded to water cooling. Now my computer has a drinking problem."
  explanation: "Anthropomorphizing the computer by applying the human problem of alcoholism to the water cooling system. The incongruity of treating a cooling system upgrade as an addiction creates accessible humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why was the USB drive always invited to parties? It had the most flash."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke using 'flash' as both the technical term (flash memory/storage) and the slang for being flashy or impressive. The personification of the USB drive adds to the humor."
  rating: 5

- text: "My RGB keyboard doesn't make me type faster, but it makes my mistakes look fabulous."
  explanation: "This uses relief theory by acknowledging the truth that aesthetic hardware upgrades don't improve performance, while finding humor in the consolation that at least errors look good. It's relatable to anyone who's bought flashy hardware."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my computer to be more positive. Now it only works with DC current."
  explanation: "A sophisticated electrical engineering joke playing on 'positive' as both an attitude and the positive terminal in direct current (DC). The misdirection from emotional positivity to electrical polarity creates the surprise."
  rating: 7

- text: "My thermal paste expired. I guess my CPU and heatsink's relationship has lost its spark."
  explanation: "This personifies the CPU-heatsink relationship as a romantic one, where thermal paste is the 'spark' that keeps them together. The joke works on understanding that thermal paste deteriorates over time and affects heat transfer."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the BIOS break up with the operating system? It needed someone more basic."
  explanation: "Playing on BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and the word 'basic' as a personality trait. The joke uses relationship metaphors to describe the technical hierarchy where BIOS is lower-level than the OS."
  rating: 7

- text: "I have 6 monitors at my desk. I still can't see what I'm doing with my life."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor using the incongruity between having extensive visual display capability and lacking life direction. The absurdity of multiple monitors not solving existential problems creates strong relatability."
  rating: 9

- text: "My computer's power supply is modular. I wish my life choices were too - I'd disconnect some bad decisions."
  explanation: "This uses the technical feature of modular PSUs (where you can add/remove cables) as a metaphor for wanting to undo life choices. The relief theory applies as it expresses a common wish through technical analogy."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't CPUs ever get lonely? They're always in their socket, surrounded by pins and needles."
  explanation: "A multi-layered joke using 'pins and needles' (the physical CPU pins, the sensation of limbs falling asleep, and the idiom for anxiety). The anthropomorphization combined with technical accuracy creates depth."
  rating: 7

- text: "I bought ECC memory because I wanted my computer to make fewer mistakes than I do. Now we're both error-free and unemployed."
  explanation: "ECC (Error-Correcting Code) memory is used in servers for reliability. The dark humor suggests that being error-free led to unemployment, playing on the fear of automation and the irony that perfection might not be desirable."
  rating: 8

- text: "My NVMe drive is so fast it loads my existential dread in microseconds. I miss the buffering time when I could pretend everything was fine."
  explanation: "This sophisticated joke uses the extreme speed of NVMe storage as a metaphor for how quickly modern life delivers stress. The nostalgia for loading times as a brief respite is both absurd and deeply relatable, using relief theory effectively."
  rating: 10

- text: "I overclocked my CPU to 5GHz. Now it processes my bad decisions 30% faster and crashes twice as spectacularly. At least the blue screen matches my mood."
  explanation: "This is a complex joke combining multiple elements: overclocking risks, the relationship between speed and instability, the visual metaphor of the blue screen of death matching depression, and the self-deprecating acknowledgment that processing bad decisions faster isn't actually helpful. It's layered with technical knowledge while being emotionally resonant."
