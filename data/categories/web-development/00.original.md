```yaml
- text: "CSS: Constantly Struggling with Styles."
  explanation: "A simple acronym play on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that reflects the common frustration web developers face when trying to achieve pixel-perfect designs and dealing with browser inconsistencies."

- text: "Why do web developers prefer dark mode? Because their future is bright enough already."
  explanation: "This joke subverts the common 'light attracts bugs' joke by playing on the optimistic outlook developers supposedly have, creating an unexpected positive twist on the dark mode preference."

- text: "HTML is like a house of cards. One missing div and everything collapses."
  explanation: "This joke uses the metaphor of a house of cards to describe the fragile nature of HTML structure, where forgetting to close a single div tag can break an entire page layout."

- text: "A web developer walks into a bar. Then a restaurant. Then a store. He was testing his navigation menu."
  explanation: "This joke uses the 'walks into a bar' format but redirects it to describe the tedious process of testing website navigation, where developers must click through every link to ensure functionality."

- text: "My website is like my diet. I keep saying I'll optimize it tomorrow."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke draws a parallel between procrastinating on website optimization and putting off personal goals, reflecting the common struggle with performance improvements."

- text: "Why did the JavaScript developer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C#."
  explanation: "A wordplay joke combining the visual impairment need for glasses with programming language names, suggesting JavaScript developers can't 'see' (or work with) C# due to their specialization."

- text: "I spent three hours debugging my CSS. Turns out I had a semicolon where I needed a colon. I need a coffee; I mean a coffee."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the frustration of hunting for tiny syntax errors in CSS while making a meta-joke about the developer's own punctuation confusion in describing the problem."

- text: "Web development is 10% coding and 90% Googling 'why isn't this centering?'"
  explanation: "This exaggeration plays on the notorious difficulty of centering elements in CSS, something that has plagued web developers for decades despite seeming like it should be simple."

- text: "My portfolio website has been 'under construction' since 2019. At this point, it's a historical monument."
  explanation: "This self-deprecating joke references the old 'under construction' pages from early web days while acknowledging the ironic situation where web developers often neglect their own websites."

- text: "Why don't web developers like nature? Too many bugs and no console to check them."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'bugs' (insects vs. code errors) and highlights developers' dependence on browser console tools for debugging, suggesting they're helpless without their digital tools."

- text: "I told my client the website would be responsive. Now it answers back when they complain about the design."
  explanation: "A clever play on the term 'responsive design' (websites that adapt to different screen sizes) by giving it a literal interpretation where the website talks back, addressing client-developer tensions."

- text: "What's a web developer's favorite tea? Proper-tea. Especially the margin and padding property."
  explanation: "A pun combining 'property' (CSS properties) with 'proper tea,' while specifically referencing margin and padding, which are fundamental and frequently adjusted CSS properties that developers work with constantly."

- text: "My JavaScript is so asynchronous, even my promises get broken before they're kept."
  explanation: "This joke cleverly uses JavaScript's asynchronous programming concepts (Promises) and applies them metaphorically to personal reliability, playing on the technical meaning of rejected promises in code."

- text: "Why did the web developer go broke? He used up all his cache."
  explanation: "A double meaning joke playing on 'cache' (browser storage) and 'cash' (money), suggesting the developer spent all his money, but framing it in technical terminology familiar to web developers."

- text: "I asked a web developer to design me a table. Three hours later, he's still arguing whether to use CSS Grid or Flexbox."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the ongoing debate in the web development community about the best layout methods, showing how developers can overthink simple tasks by getting caught up in technical decisions."

- text: "Web accessibility is important. That's why I make sure my error messages are readable by everyone."
  explanation: "A darkly humorous take on web accessibility that subverts expectationsâ€”instead of making the site itself accessible, the developer ensures everyone can equally read the error messages when things break."

- text: "My relationship status is like my CSS: complicated, full of !important declarations, and nobody really understands why it works."
  explanation: "This joke uses CSS specificity and the !important declaration (often considered bad practice) as a metaphor for relationship complexity, suggesting both are messy and rely on brute force rather than elegant solutions."

- text: "A SQL query walks into a bar, approaches two tables, and asks: 'Mind if I JOIN you?'"
  explanation: "While technically a database joke, it's essential for web developers. This plays on SQL's JOIN operation for combining tables with the social act of joining people at tables in a bar, creating a perfect technical-social parallel."

- text: "Why did the front-end developer quit? Because he didn't get arrays. The back-end developer didn't get his jokes either."
  explanation: "A multi-layered joke playing on 'get arrays' (understand arrays) and 'get a raise' (salary increase), while also highlighting the communication gap between front-end and back-end developers with the meta-joke about joke comprehension."

- text: "I love web development. It's the only field where 'it works on my machine' is both a technical statement and a cry for help."
  explanation: "This joke captures the universal developer experience of code working locally but failing in production, elevating the common phrase to represent both a factual observation and existential despair."

- text: "My code is like a good website: it doesn't work on Internet Explorer, but nobody cares anymore."
  explanation: "This joke celebrates the end of IE support while acknowledging the years of pain it caused developers. It's both a victory lap and a reminder of the browser compatibility nightmares that defined an era of web development."
