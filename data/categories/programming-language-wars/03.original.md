```yaml
- text: "C++ developers don't argue with Java developers. They just have different pointer views."
  explanation: "A simple pun playing on 'point of view' and C++'s pointer feature, which Java lacks. This establishes the language war theme with a gentle wordplay."

- text: "Why do Python programmers prefer dark mode? Because they can't C#."
  explanation: "A basic visual pun connecting the inability to 'see sharp' (C# programming language) with dark mode preferences. Uses the setup-punchline structure with language name wordplay."

- text: "JavaScript developers are optimistic. They believe 'undefined' is just a state of mind."
  explanation: "References JavaScript's notorious 'undefined' value while playing with philosophical concepts, using the superiority theory to gently mock JS's quirks."

- text: "A SQL developer walks into a NoSQL bar. He leaves because he couldn't find a table."
  explanation: "Classic misdirection joke using the double meaning of 'table' (furniture vs. database structure) to highlight the fundamental difference between SQL and NoSQL databases."

- text: "Rust developers write safe code. Everyone else writes 'trust me, bro' code."
  explanation: "Contrasts Rust's memory safety guarantees with other languages' reliance on programmer discipline, using modern internet slang for comedic effect."

- text: "Why did the Go developer refuse to play hide and seek? They hate dealing with exceptions."
  explanation: "References Go's controversial design choice to avoid exception handling, using the incongruity of applying programming concepts to children's games."

- text: "PHP: The only language where you can write 'it works on my machine' and mean your refrigerator."
  explanation: "Exaggerates PHP's reputation for running anywhere and everywhere, even on IoT devices, using absurdity to create humor about PHP's ubiquity."

- text: "A Haskell programmer walks into a bar. The bar doesn't exist yet, but it's lazily evaluated when they order a drink."
  explanation: "References Haskell's lazy evaluation feature through a walking-into-a-bar joke format, creating humor through the application of technical concepts to physical reality."

- text: "Ruby developers believe in magic. Rails developers believe in too much magic."
  explanation: "Plays on Ruby's philosophy of 'magic' (convention over configuration) and escalates it to critique Rails' abstraction layers, using gradation for comedic effect."

- text: "Why don't C developers ever get lost? Because they always know their address."
  explanation: "Simple pun on memory addresses in C programming, connecting low-level programming concepts with everyday navigation metaphors."

- text: "TypeScript is just JavaScript that went to therapy and learned to communicate its feelings."
  explanation: "Uses personification and psychological metaphor to describe TypeScript's type system as emotional expression, creating relatable humor about static typing."

- text: "A COBOL programmer died. The funeral was scheduled for 1999, but they had to postpone it due to Y2K concerns."
  explanation: "Combines COBOL's legacy status with the Y2K crisis, using dark humor and temporal paradox to mock the language's age and continued relevance."

- text: "Kotlin developers are just Java developers who finally found the courage to leave their toxic relationship."
  explanation: "Uses relationship therapy metaphor to describe language migration, applying relief theory to the frustrations of Java's verbosity."

- text: "Why did the assembly programmer break up with the Python programmer? Too many levels of abstraction between them."
  explanation: "Creates a romantic metaphor for the fundamental philosophical divide between low-level and high-level programming, using relationship humor for technical concepts."

- text: "Lisp developers have no problem with recursion. They just keep calling themselves until they understand it."
  explanation: "Self-referential joke that uses recursion to explain recursion, creating meta-humor while referencing Lisp's functional programming paradigm."

- text: "Swift developers: 'Our code is safe, modern, and elegant.' Objective-C developers: 'Our code still runs.'"
  explanation: "Contrasts idealism with pragmatism, using dialogue format to highlight the tension between new and legacy systems in Apple's ecosystem."

- text: "A Perl developer's code is like their handwritingâ€”only they can read it, and even that's questionable after six months."
  explanation: "Extended metaphor about Perl's reputation for write-only code, using temporal distance to emphasize the readability problem even for the original author."

- text: "Scala: Because sometimes you want to write Java, but with the smugness of a Haskell developer and the job market of neither."
  explanation: "Multi-layered joke that simultaneously mocks three languages and their communities, using superiority theory and harsh reality for comedic effect."

- text: "Why do Fortran programmers never retire? Because they're still maintaining code from before retirement was invented."
  explanation: "Absurdist joke about Fortran's extreme longevity, creating a temporal paradox where the code is older than the concept it references."

- text: "JavaScript: Where you can add an array to an object, multiply it by a string, and get 'Tuesday'. The error message? 'This is fine.'"
  explanation: "Exaggerates JavaScript's type coercion chaos to absurdist levels, combining it with the 'This is fine' meme to capture developer resignation to JS's quirks."

- text: "A C++ developer, a Rust developer, and a Go developer walk into a bar. The C++ developer segfaults before ordering. The Rust developer spends three hours convincing the bartender their order is memory-safe. The Go developer orders a beer, but it comes with 15 microservices they didn't ask for and a lecture about simplicity."
  explanation: "Elaborate setup-punchline structure that simultaneously satirizes three languages' core characteristics (C++'s memory dangers, Rust's steep learning curve, Go's opinionated simplicity), using escalating absurdity and the classic bar joke format to create layered humor about language philosophy wars."
