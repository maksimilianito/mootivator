- text: "Documentation is like a time capsule—we write it for our future selves, then forget we buried it."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common practice of writing documentation that later goes unused or forgotten, comparing it to a time capsule that's meant to preserve information but often gets lost or ignored."

- text: "Why did the developer write documentation? His manager was watching."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory to highlight the reality that documentation is often written only when required rather than as a best practice, revealing the gap between ideal and actual developer behavior."

- text: "Our API documentation is so good, it almost explains what the API does."
  explanation: "This employs ironic understatement to mock poor documentation quality—the documentation fails at its primary purpose of explaining functionality."

- text: "I spent three hours debugging before reading the docs. The docs were wrong anyway, so I saved 30 seconds."
  explanation: "This joke uses misdirection and exaggeration to capture the frustration with outdated documentation, while also poking fun at developers' reluctance to read documentation first."

- text: "What's the difference between documentation and fantasy fiction? Fantasy fiction has better world-building."
  explanation: "This comparison joke uses incongruity by equating technical documentation with creative fiction, suggesting documentation is often incomplete or inconsistent in describing the software 'world.'"

- text: "The documentation said 'self-explanatory.' That's when I knew I was in trouble."
  explanation: "This plays on the irony that labeling something as 'self-explanatory' in documentation often means it's poorly explained or confusing, creating an expectation-versus-reality conflict."

- text: "Why don't developers trust documentation? Because it's always one commit behind."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the common problem of documentation becoming outdated immediately after code changes, using the technical term 'commit' to ground it in developer experience."

- text: "I found a bug in the documentation. The bug was that it existed—the feature doesn't."
  explanation: "This uses layered incongruity where the 'bug' isn't a mistake in the docs but rather that the docs describe something that was never implemented."

- text: "Documentation status: TODO. Priority: TODO. Last updated: When we still had hope."
  explanation: "This joke uses the format of actual documentation metadata to create humor through the progression from incomplete markers to existential despair, reflecting real developer burnout."

- text: "Why did the README file go to therapy? It had an identity crisis—nobody knew if it was documentation or decoration."
  explanation: "This personification joke captures the reality that README files often contain outdated or superficial information that serves no practical purpose."

- text: "The best documentation is the code itself, said the developer who never had to maintain anyone else's code."
  explanation: "This uses ironic perspective-switching to mock the 'self-documenting code' philosophy by highlighting its failure in real-world maintenance scenarios."

- text: "How do you know documentation is outdated? It mentions Python 2."
  explanation: "This uses a specific technical reference to Python 2's end-of-life as a humorous marker of ancient, neglected documentation, relying on shared cultural knowledge in the programming community."

- text: "I wrote comprehensive documentation for my project. Then I woke up."
  explanation: "This uses the 'it was all a dream' twist to suggest that comprehensive documentation is so rare it's literally fantasy, employing absurdity for comedic effect."

- text: "Why did the documentation have so many examples? Because each one contradicted the previous one."
  explanation: "This joke uses progressive revelation—what seems like a positive (many examples) becomes negative (inconsistency), highlighting poor documentation quality through internal contradiction."

- text: "Our documentation follows semantic versioning: 1.0.0 means 'we started,' 2.0.0 means 'we gave up,' and 3.0.0 doesn't exist."
  explanation: "This parodies the semantic versioning system by applying it to documentation lifecycle stages, creating humor through the misapplication of a technical standard to human behavior patterns."

- text: "A developer walks into a library. 'Where's your documentation section?' The librarian points to Fiction. 'No, technical documentation.' The librarian doesn't move her hand."
  explanation: "This narrative joke uses a classic setup with a clever punchline that equates technical documentation with fiction, suggesting it's equally unreliable or imaginative."

- text: "Why did the documentation win an award? It was recognized for 'Most Creative Interpretation of Actual Functionality.'"
  explanation: "This uses mock-award humor to highlight how documentation often misrepresents or over-promises what the software actually does, treating inaccuracy as an achievement."

- text: "I asked ChatGPT to explain our API. It read the docs and said, 'Have you tried reading the source code?'"
  explanation: "This meta-humor joke uses the current AI trend to suggest that even artificial intelligence finds the documentation inadequate, adding a layer of modern relevance to traditional documentation complaints."

- text: "Documentation writing is like flossing—everyone agrees it's important, everyone knows they should do it, and everyone lies about doing it regularly."
  explanation: "This analogy joke uses a universally relatable health habit to create a perfect parallel with documentation practices, employing the superiority theory through shared guilt."

- text: "The documentation said 'deprecated.' I said 'when?' It said 'before you were hired.' I said 'then why is it still in production?' The documentation stopped responding."
  explanation: "This dialogue-format joke creates humor through the absurd personification of documentation and captures the frustrating reality of deprecated features remaining in production systems indefinitely."

- text: "Why did the senior developer print out the documentation? So when someone asked 'Is this documented?' he could say 'Yes' while pointing at the recycling bin."
  explanation: "This joke combines physical comedy with cynical workplace humor, using the act of printing documentation only to discard it as a metaphor for documentation's perceived uselessness, while technically fulfilling the requirement."
