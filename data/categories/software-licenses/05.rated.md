- text: "I tried to read the GPL, but it was longer than my code."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common complaint that open-source licenses like the GNU General Public License are extremely lengthy and complex, often exceeding the actual code they're meant to protect. The humor comes from the absurdity that legal text outweighs the creative work itself."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer choose MIT license? Because he wanted his code to be free, unlike his time."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'free' - the MIT license provides freedom to use code, while the developer's time is not free (they must be paid). It highlights the irony that developers give away code freely while their labor has value."
  rating: 8

- text: "Proprietary software is like a black box. Open source is like a transparent box full of spiders."
  explanation: "This joke uses the incongruity theory - while open source promises transparency, looking inside reveals complexity and potential problems ('spiders'). It suggests that sometimes ignorance is bliss, subverting the usual pro-open-source narrative."
  rating: 9

- text: "The EULA was so long, I just scrolled to the bottom and agreed to sell my soul."
  explanation: "This plays on the universal experience of accepting End User License Agreements without reading them, combined with the exaggerated fear that they contain unreasonable terms. The hyperbole about selling one's soul makes the common behavior absurd."
  rating: 6

- text: "I'm not saying our licensing model is complicated, but our lawyers need lawyers."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration to mock overly complex licensing schemes. The recursive nature of 'lawyers needing lawyers' emphasizes how convoluted some software licensing arrangements have become."
  rating: 7

- text: "Open source: where you're free to use the code, but morally obligated to contribute back at 3 AM."
  explanation: "This captures the unwritten social contract of open-source communities. The specific time '3 AM' adds humor by suggesting the guilt-driven, late-night coding sessions that community pressure can inspire."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why don't proprietary software companies tell jokes? Because they're afraid someone will fork the punchline."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'fork' (creating a separate version of software) as a pun. It satirizes proprietary companies' fear of losing control, applying it absurdly to jokes themselves."
  rating: 7

- text: "I released my code under the 'Good Luck With That' license."
  explanation: "This creates a fictional, humorous license name that captures developer frustration. It subverts formal licensing terminology with casual, dismissive language that many developers might secretly feel about their old code."
  rating: 8

- text: "The difference between open source and proprietary software? One lets you see the mess, the other just charges you for it."
  explanation: "This uses the superiority theory by acknowledging that all software is messy. The joke creates equivalence between the two models while highlighting their different approaches to transparency and monetization."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our company switched to GPL compliance. Now we have a full-time position just for reading licenses."
  explanation: "This exaggerates the complexity of GPL compliance to absurd levels, suggesting it requires an entire employee. It reflects real concerns about the overhead of open-source license management in corporate environments."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why did the startup fail? They spent more time choosing a license than building the product."
  explanation: "This satirizes analysis paralysis in the startup world, where developers might obsess over licensing decisions while neglecting the actual product. The misdirection creates humor through misplaced priorities."
  rating: 7

- text: "I love copyleft licenses. They're like a boomerang - whatever you throw out comes back to you."
  explanation: "This uses a metaphor to explain copyleft licenses (like GPL) where modifications must be shared back. The boomerang image makes the reciprocal obligation both visual and slightly threatening."
  rating: 8

- text: "The Apache License is perfect for developers who want freedom without commitment issues."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes the permissive Apache License as a relationship style. It plays on the license's minimal restrictions while using the language of modern dating culture to create unexpected humor."
  rating: 7

- text: "I asked my lawyer if I could use that library. Three weeks and $5,000 later, he said 'maybe.'"
  explanation: "This joke highlights the frustration of obtaining legal advice on software licensing. The absurdity comes from the expensive, time-consuming process yielding an unhelpful, uncertain answer."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the developer create his own license? Because reading existing ones was harder than writing new code."
  explanation: "This captures a real phenomenon where developers create custom licenses out of frustration. The irony is that creating a new license likely causes more problems than it solves, but seems easier than understanding existing ones."
  rating: 7

- text: "Open source is communism for code, except it actually works and nobody starves."
  explanation: "This provocative joke plays with political metaphors while acknowledging open source's success. It uses the incongruity between failed political systems and successful software collaboration to create humor through unexpected comparison."
  rating: 6

- text: "My code is licensed under Creative Commons. Mainly because I got creative, and it's now common knowledge that it doesn't work."
  explanation: "This is a self-deprecating joke that reinterprets 'Creative Commons' literally. The wordplay on 'creative' and 'common' creates a double meaning where the license name accidentally describes bad code."
  rating: 9

- text: "The software was free, but the license compliance audit cost us six figures. Turns out 'free' is relative."
  explanation: "This joke exposes the hidden costs of 'free' open-source software through compliance requirements. The philosophical observation about 'free being relative' adds depth while highlighting an uncomfortable truth about enterprise software."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do developers fear the AGPL? Because it's the license that follows you home."
  explanation: "This personifies the Affero GPL as something sinister that 'follows you home,' playing on its requirement to share source code even for network services. The stalker metaphor makes the license's reach seem ominously persistent."
  rating: 8

- text: "I dual-licensed my project: GPL for people I like, and a custom license for everyone else that just says 'Please don't sue me, I'm just one person with a cat.'"
  explanation: "This combines the concept of dual-licensing with absurdist humor and vulnerability. The contrast between the formal GPL and the pathetic personal plea creates humor through extreme incongruity, while the cat detail adds relatable developer culture."
  rating: 9

- text: "The company lawyer reviewed our dependencies. We're now rewriting everything from scratch. Turns out 'public domain' doesn't mean 'found it on Stack Overflow.'"
  explanation: "This joke builds to a perfect punchline that reveals a fundamental misunderstanding about code licensing. It satirizes the common practice of copying code from Stack Overflow while exposing the legal minefield this creates, with the lawyer's dramatic solution adding to the absurdity."
