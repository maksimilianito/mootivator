```yaml
- text: "My code runs faster on my manager's computer because he has more RAM—Random Approval Metrics."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of RAM (Random Access Memory vs. Random Approval Metrics), suggesting that code performance is subjectively evaluated rather than objectively measured."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the algorithm go to the gym? It wanted to reduce its complexity."
  explanation: "A simple pun on 'complexity' which in computer science refers to algorithmic efficiency (Big O notation), but here is applied to physical fitness, creating an incongruity between technical and everyday contexts."
  rating: 5

- text: "My code is so optimized, it finishes before it starts. Now I have a causality bug."
  explanation: "This absurdist joke exaggerates optimization to the point of violating physics, creating humor through the impossible scenario of code being too fast."
  rating: 8

- text: "The database was slow, so we added an index. Now it's a slow database with an index."
  explanation: "This joke reflects the real frustration when optimization attempts fail, using misdirection where we expect improvement but get the same problem with added complexity."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers confuse Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25, and both celebrations cause system slowdowns."
  explanation: "A classic octal/decimal joke extended with a performance angle—the humor comes from the mathematical wordplay (octal 31 equals decimal 25) plus the observation about holiday-related system issues."
  rating: 6

- text: "I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My users still complain it's slow. Turns out n is a billion."
  explanation: "This joke highlights the gap between theoretical optimization and practical performance, where Big O improvements don't matter when the input size is astronomical."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our server handles millions of requests per second! Just not the ones from actual users."
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke that mocks misleading benchmarks, suggesting that synthetic tests don't reflect real-world performance."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why was the cache embarrassed? It had too many misses in public."
  explanation: "A personification joke using the technical term 'cache miss' (when requested data isn't in cache) as a metaphor for social failure, creating a double meaning."
  rating: 6

- text: "I spent three weeks optimizing my code to run in 2 seconds instead of 3. The function is called once a day."
  explanation: "This joke uses incongruity between effort and value, highlighting the common programmer mistake of premature optimization where the time investment vastly exceeds the benefit."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code is like a fine wine—it gets slower with age and nobody knows why."
  explanation: "A twist on the 'fine wine improves with age' cliche, applying it ironically to code that degrades over time, reflecting the reality of technical debt and performance regression."
  rating: 7

- text: "We don't have performance issues. We have expectation management opportunities."
  explanation: "Corporate-speak humor that reframes slowness as a communication problem rather than a technical one, satirizing how companies spin negative situations."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer quit his job? The company said 'performance review' but he heard 'performance review query' and it timed out."
  explanation: "A layered joke combining workplace anxiety with database terminology, where a slow query becomes a metaphor for an unbearably long evaluation process."
  rating: 7

- text: "I wrote a program to find bottlenecks. It's still running. I think I found one."
  explanation: "Self-referential humor where the profiling tool itself becomes the bottleneck, creating an ironic situation that demonstrates the problem it was meant to solve."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our new caching strategy is revolutionary—we cache the complaints about how slow everything is."
  explanation: "Absurdist humor that suggests caching user complaints instead of fixing performance, satirizing companies that prioritize managing perception over solving problems."
  rating: 8

- text: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil. So is late optimization. And on-time optimization. Really, it's just optimization."
  explanation: "This joke deconstructs the famous Donald Knuth quote by extending it to absurdity, suggesting that optimization itself is problematic regardless of timing, reflecting programmer frustration."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code runs at the speed of light! Specifically, the speed of light through molasses. In winter. On a Monday."
  explanation: "A multi-layered misdirection joke that builds expectations with 'speed of light' then systematically deflates them with increasingly restrictive conditions."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the loop take forever? It was waiting for the previous iteration to finish waiting for the iteration before that."
  explanation: "This joke creates humor through recursive dependency and deadlock scenarios, where the circular waiting pattern makes progress impossible—a common concurrency problem."
  rating: 7

- text: "I parallelized my code across 16 cores. Now it's slow in 16 places simultaneously. That's efficiency!"
  explanation: "A superiority theory joke that mocks failed parallelization attempts, where adding complexity doesn't improve performance but distributes the slowness across more resources."
  rating: 9

- text: "The code is perfectly optimized. It's the laws of physics that need refactoring."
  explanation: "An absurdist reversal that blames reality rather than the code, satirizing developers who refuse to acknowledge performance problems and instead blame external factors."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our system has three states: fast, slow, and 'let me check the logs to see if it's actually running.' We're usually in state three."
  explanation: "This joke extends the typical binary fast/slow categorization to include the meta-state of uncertainty, reflecting real debugging experiences where you can't even tell if something is slow or broken."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally achieved zero-latency communication between microservices. Turns out they were all running on the same machine. The architect is not amused."
  explanation: "A sophisticated joke about distributed systems where the 'optimization' defeats the purpose of microservices architecture, creating humor through the gap between technical success and architectural failure while highlighting the tension between performance and design principles."
