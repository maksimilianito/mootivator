  explanation: "This joke uses stereotypes about each OS community: Windows for ubiquity, Mac for premium pricing, and Linux for DIY culture and evangelism. The bar setting makes it accessible."

- text: "The difference between operating systems: Windows assumes you're an idiot. macOS knows you're an idiot but makes you feel smart. Linux assumes you're a genius and then proves you're an idiot. And BSD? BSD doesn't care what you are because you're probably the only one using it."
  explanation: "Comprehensive comparative joke that escalates through each OS, using superiority theory to poke fun at all user bases equally. The BSD punchline adds an extra layer by suggesting obscurity, making it a multi-layered joke that builds to a final twist."
