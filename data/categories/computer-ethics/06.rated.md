- text: "I always delete my browser history. It's called ethical computing."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the double meaning of 'ethical computing' - supposedly about digital responsibility, but really just hiding embarrassing browsing habits. The humor comes from the gap between the serious-sounding term and the mundane, self-interested action."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why do ethical hackers make terrible thieves? They always leave a detailed report of what they took."
  explanation: "This uses the incongruity between criminal behavior and professional ethics. Ethical hackers (penetration testers) are required to document everything they do, which would defeat the purpose of actual theft. The joke highlights the contradiction through exaggeration."
  rating: 8

- text: "My code respects user privacy. It doesn't even work well enough to collect data."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor that suggests accidental ethics through incompetence. The setup implies moral superiority, but the punchline reveals it's just broken code - a relief theory joke that lets programmers laugh at their own bugs."
  rating: 9

- text: "I practice responsible AI development: I blame the algorithm, not myself."
  explanation: "This satirizes the common practice of deflecting responsibility for algorithmic decisions. The humor comes from the speaker genuinely thinking this constitutes 'responsible development' when it's actually the opposite."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's the difference between a data scientist and a stalker? A Terms of Service agreement."
  explanation: "Dark humor that points out how thin the line is between invasive surveillance and 'legitimate' data collection. The joke uses the superiority theory by making us uncomfortable with how we've normalized corporate data harvesting."
  rating: 9

- text: "I read the entire privacy policy. Now I need a privacy policy for all the things I learned about the company."
  explanation: "This reverses the expected power dynamic - usually companies learn everything about users. The joke suggests privacy policies reveal so much about corporate practices that the reader needs protection. Uses misdirection effectively."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the programmer refuse to fix the accessibility bug? He couldn't see the problem."
  explanation: "A layered joke that works literally (he's not affected by the accessibility issue) and metaphorically (privileged blindness to others' needs). The wordplay on 'see' makes it work on multiple levels."
  rating: 9

- text: "Our AI is completely unbiased. We trained it exclusively on our own company's data."
  explanation: "Satirizes corporate claims of fairness while describing the exact opposite. The speaker's confidence in stating something that creates maximum bias is where the absurdity lies. This is incongruity theory at its finest."
  rating: 8

- text: "How do you know if someone writes ethical code? Don't worry, their commit messages will tell you."
  explanation: "Parodies the 'how do you know someone is vegan' joke format. Pokes fun at performative ethics where developers are more interested in appearing ethical than doing the hard work of actually being ethical."
  rating: 7

- text: "I believe in the right to be forgotten. That's why I never comment my code."
  explanation: "Twists a fundamental digital rights concept (GDPR's right to erasure) into an excuse for bad programming practice. The joke uses the relief theory - we've all written uncommented code and this gives us permission to laugh about it."
  rating: 8

- text: "What's a hacker's favorite philosophical question? If you exploit a vulnerability and nobody patches it, does it make a sound?"
  explanation: "Parodies the 'tree falling in forest' philosophical question while highlighting the responsibility gap in cybersecurity. The absurdity comes from applying deep philosophy to the mundane question of who's responsible for security."
  rating: 7

- text: "My startup's motto: Move fast and break things. Mainly regulations and user trust."
  explanation: "Takes Facebook's infamous motto and makes explicit what was always implicit. The humor comes from the honesty about what 'breaking things' actually meant in practice. Uses superiority theory by making us feel smarter than those who fell for the original motto."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why don't cryptocurrency miners believe in climate change? They're too busy generating it."
  explanation: "Dark environmental humor that points out the contradiction between crypto's futuristic image and its environmental impact. The wordplay on 'generating' (both coins and emissions) makes it work structurally."
  rating: 8

- text: "I'm developing an ethical AI that tells you when you shouldn't develop an AI. It told me to stop. I'm ignoring it."
  explanation: "A recursive paradox joke that highlights how people often ignore ethical concerns even when they claim to prioritize them. The meta-humor comes from the AI's first recommendation being to stop creating it, which the developer immediately violates."
  rating: 9

- text: "What do you call a programmer who actually reads the ethics guidelines? Unemployed. He kept refusing projects."
  explanation: "Cynical humor about the conflict between ethical standards and business reality. The joke suggests that following ethics is professionally disadvantageous, using dark comedy to highlight systemic problems in tech culture."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our company takes data privacy seriously. We encrypt everything before selling it."
  explanation: "Satirizes corporate double-speak where technical security measures are presented as privacy protection while the fundamental violation (selling data) continues. The absurdity is in thinking encryption somehow makes the sale ethical."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the developer's ethical framework crash? Stack overflow from too many nested rationalizations."
  explanation: "Uses programming terminology (stack overflow) as a metaphor for moral reasoning collapse. The joke suggests that ethical compromises compound recursively until the whole system fails - a sophisticated technical metaphor for moral failure."
  rating: 10

- text: "I practice ethical hacking. I only steal from databases that don't respect my privacy settings."
  explanation: "Creates a absurd moral framework where privacy violations justify theft - fighting fire with fire logic taken to ridiculous extremes. The humor comes from the speaker genuinely believing this constitutes 'ethical' behavior."
  rating: 7

- text: "What's the difference between a bug and an unethical feature? About six months and a leaked memo."
  explanation: "Cynical joke about how companies rebrand intentional bad behavior as accidents when caught. References real scandals where 'bugs' were later revealed to be deliberate features. Uses timing and revelation as the punchline structure."
  rating: 9

- text: "My code is open source, which means everyone can see my ethical shortcuts and judge me equally."
  explanation: "Self-deprecating humor about how transparency doesn't necessarily mean virtue - it just makes your failings public. The joke subverts the expectation that open source is inherently more ethical by suggesting it just distributes the blame."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the AI ethicist quit? She realized she was just writing permission slips for things that were going to happen anyway. Her replacement is a shell script that outputs 'Proceed with caution' regardless of input."
  explanation: "The longest and darkest joke, this is a two-part critique of ethics washing in tech. First it suggests ethicists are powerless rubber stamps, then it takes it further by suggesting they could be replaced with a trivial script. The specific technical detail of the shell script makes it funnier because it's so simple, emphasizing how little actual ethical reasoning is valued. This is the climax joke that synthesizes multiple humor theories: superiority (we're smart enough to see through the charade), incongruity (ethics reduced to a bash script), and relief (laughing at a depressing truth)."
