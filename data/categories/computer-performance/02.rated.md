```yaml
- text: "My code runs faster on the staging server than production. It's like it knows when people are watching."
  explanation: "This joke plays on the common experience where code seems to perform differently in different environments, anthropomorphizing the code as if it has stage fright or awareness of its audience."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the developer's optimization take so long? He was optimizing the optimization process first."
  explanation: "This uses recursive humor and the incongruity of spending more time preparing to optimize than actually optimizing, a common trap in performance tuning."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our app is so slow, users think the loading spinner is the actual feature."
  explanation: "This exaggerates a performance problem to absurdity, suggesting the symptom of slowness has become confused with the product itself."
  rating: 9

- text: "I optimized my code from O(n²) to O(n log n). My boss asked why it still takes 3 seconds. Turns out n was 5."
  explanation: "This highlights the gap between theoretical algorithmic improvements and practical performance gains, where Big O notation becomes meaningless for small datasets."
  rating: 10

- text: "What's the difference between a slow computer and a fast one? About 30 minutes of waiting to find out."
  explanation: "A self-referential joke where the punchline demonstrates the very problem it's describing—you have to wait to know about waiting."
  rating: 6

- text: "My manager said to make the app 'feel' faster. So I added more loading animations."
  explanation: "This satirizes the practice of perceived performance optimization over actual performance improvements, a common shortcut in UI/UX design."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why do programmers love caching? Because remembering is always faster than thinking."
  explanation: "This uses a human metaphor to explain a technical concept, drawing a parallel between human memory and computer caching strategies."
  rating: 7

- text: "I spent three days optimizing a function that runs once at startup. I'm very good at prioritization."
  explanation: "This is self-deprecating humor about misplaced optimization efforts, violating the principle of optimizing bottlenecks rather than convenient targets."
  rating: 8

- text: "The bottleneck is always in the last place you look. Mainly because you stop looking after you find it."
  explanation: "This plays on the common saying about lost items, applying it to performance debugging with a logical twist that makes the truism actually meaningful."
  rating: 9

- text: "How do you make your code run faster? Run it on your manager's computer during the demo."
  explanation: "This combines the observation that demos often run on better hardware with the incongruity of that being presented as an optimization strategy."
  rating: 7

- text: "My code is perfectly optimized. It just needs faster hardware, better network, more memory, and lower user expectations."
  explanation: "This lists every possible external factor, satirizing the tendency to blame everything except the code itself for performance issues."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the algorithm go to therapy? It had O(n!) complexity and couldn't cope with growth."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes an algorithm with factorial complexity, using 'cope with growth' as a double meaning for both scaling issues and personal development."
  rating: 8

- text: "I don't have performance issues. I have 'eventual consistency' with user expectations."
  explanation: "This borrows a database term to reframe slowness as a distributed systems feature, using technical jargon to justify poor performance."
  rating: 9

- text: "What's a programmer's favorite exercise? Benchmarking. It's the only running they do."
  explanation: "This plays on the double meaning of 'running' (code vs. physical exercise) while poking fun at programmer stereotypes about physical activity."
  rating: 6

- text: "My app loads instantly! Well, after the 2-minute compilation, 30-second startup, and initial cache warming."
  explanation: "This uses selective framing to make a slow process sound fast by choosing an arbitrary starting point, mocking misleading performance claims."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why was the database administrator always calm? He knew that premature optimization is the root of all evil, so he optimized his stress levels last."
  explanation: "This twists the famous Donald Knuth quote, applying the principle of delayed optimization to personal stress management in an absurd way."
  rating: 8

- text: "I finally found the bottleneck! It was the developer. Specifically, me. Writing slow code."
  explanation: "This subverts expectations by making the search for a technical bottleneck lead to a human cause, with self-aware humor about code quality."
  rating: 8

- text: "Our system is so well-optimized, it can handle 10,000 concurrent users. We have 3, but we're ready."
  explanation: "This highlights the absurdity of over-optimization and premature scaling, where the solution vastly exceeds the actual problem."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why did the loop refuse optimization? It said, 'I'm not the bottleneck, I'm just the most obvious suspect.' The real culprit was the database query inside it."
  explanation: "This personifies code elements in a detective story format, illustrating the common mistake of optimizing visible code while missing hidden performance killers."
  rating: 7

- text: "I replaced all my for-loops with while-loops. Performance unchanged, but now my code looks more philosophical—it's always questioning whether to continue."
  explanation: "This creates humor through the absurdity of a meaningless refactoring paired with an anthropomorphic interpretation of while-loop syntax as existential questioning."
  rating: 8

- text: "The senior developer's secret to performance? He writes slow code first, then deletes half of it. Not the slow half—just half. Statistically, it works 50% of the time, every time."
  explanation: "This combines absurdist logic with a movie reference, mocking random optimization approaches while presenting them as wisdom, with the self-contradicting 'statistically works 50% of the time, every time' adding another layer of mathematical absurdity."
