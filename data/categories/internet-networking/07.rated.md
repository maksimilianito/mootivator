- text: "My ISP said they'd send someone between 8 AM and 6 PM. I took the whole decade off work."
  explanation: "This joke uses exaggeration to highlight the notoriously vague and unreliable appointment windows that internet service providers give customers. The humor comes from extending '8 AM to 6 PM' (already a frustratingly long window) to an absurd 'decade,' reflecting how it feels waiting for ISP technicians."
  rating: 7

- text: "Why did the website go to therapy? It had too many issues with commitment."
  explanation: "This employs a double meaning - 'commitment' in relationships versus 'commits' in version control or database transactions. The personification of a website having relationship problems creates incongruity between technical and emotional contexts."
  rating: 6

- text: "I tried to catch fog yesterday. Mist. Same thing happens when I try to catch my WiFi signal."
  explanation: "This joke uses wordplay ('mist' sounds like 'missed') and draws a parallel between the intangible nature of fog and unreliable WiFi connectivity, creating humor through the absurdity of trying to physically catch either one."
  rating: 5

- text: "The cloud is just someone else's computer that you hope is having a better day than yours."
  explanation: "This demystifies 'cloud computing' by reducing it to its literal meaning while adding the relatable anxiety about depending on infrastructure you don't control. The superiority theory applies as we laugh at our shared helplessness."
  rating: 9

- text: "My internet is so slow, I clicked on a link and had time to get married, have kids, and watch them graduate."
  explanation: "Hyperbolic exaggeration is used to express the frustration of slow internet speeds. The incongruity between the digital action (clicking a link) and major life events creates absurdist humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "Why don't networks ever get lonely? Because they're always connected to their peers."
  explanation: "This uses the double meaning of 'peers' (friends in social context vs. peer-to-peer networking) and 'connected' (emotionally vs. technically) to create a pun that anthropomorphizes network topology."
  rating: 5

- text: "I have a great relationship with my router. We're on the same wavelength. Literally."
  explanation: "The joke plays on the literal meaning of 'wavelength' (electromagnetic waves used in WiFi) versus the figurative expression about people understanding each other, creating humor through the technical precision of the statement."
  rating: 7

- text: "404: Joke Not Found. Please check your sense of humor and try again."
  explanation: "This meta-joke uses the familiar HTTP 404 error message format to comment on itself, creating recursive humor. It's funny because it uses internet culture to make a joke about jokes, while technically being a joke itself."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the packet go to school? To get a better education on routing."
  explanation: "This personifies network packets and uses the double meaning of 'routing' (network path selection vs. establishing routines/habits). The setup-punchline structure applies technical concepts to everyday situations."
  rating: 4

- text: "My bandwidth is like my patience - limited and easily exhausted by streaming services."
  explanation: "This creates a parallel between technical limitations (bandwidth) and human limitations (patience), both of which are consumed by the same activity. The relief theory applies as it expresses shared frustration."
  rating: 7

- text: "The internet never forgets, but it always seems to forget my password."
  explanation: "This highlights the ironic contradiction between the internet's permanent record of everything and the user's inability to remember credentials. The incongruity between these two 'memory' concepts creates the humor."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the firewall break up with the router? Too many trust issues."
  explanation: "This anthropomorphizes network security equipment and plays on the firewall's function (blocking untrusted traffic) as relationship problems. The technical accuracy enhances the humor for knowledgeable audiences."
  rating: 6

- text: "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. Same with my home network - why have a test environment when you can have a test-in-production disaster?"
  explanation: "This extends the famous 'Most Interesting Man' meme format while highlighting the dangerous but common practice of testing in live environments. The self-deprecating humor acknowledges poor practices we're all guilty of."
  rating: 8

- text: "Ping: Are you there? Pong: Yes. Ping: Are you there? Pong: YES. Ping: Are you there? Pong: I SAID YES! This is basically my relationship with my ISP's customer service."
  explanation: "This personifies the ping-pong network diagnostic protocol as an increasingly frustrated conversation, paralleling the repetitive and unhelpful nature of ISP customer service interactions. The escalation creates comedic timing."
  rating: 9

- text: "Why do DNS servers make terrible comedians? Because they can't resolve their own issues, let alone yours."
  explanation: "This uses the technical term 'resolve' (DNS resolution of domain names to IP addresses) in its colloquial meaning (solving problems). The joke structure suggests DNS servers have the same problems as failed comedians."
  rating: 7

- text: "There are two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and getting three bars of WiFi signal in your bedroom."
  explanation: "This riffs on the famous Phil Karlton quote about two hard problems, but adds a third (breaking the pattern), and makes it about the relatable frustration of poor WiFi coverage at home. The incongruity of mixing profound CS problems with mundane WiFi issues creates humor."
  rating: 10

- text: "My home network has more drama than a soap opera. The printer refuses to talk to the laptop, the smart TV thinks it's better than everyone else, and the IoT devices are planning a rebellion."
  explanation: "This extensively anthropomorphizes network devices as characters in a drama, with each having personality traits that reflect their real technical behaviors (printer connectivity issues, smart TV resource consumption, IoT security concerns)."
  rating: 8

- text: "Why did the VPN go to confession? It had been hiding its true identity for too long and felt guilty about all the geo-restrictions it had bypassed."
  explanation: "This personifies a VPN's technical function (hiding IP addresses and bypassing geographic restrictions) as moral guilt requiring confession. The incongruity between technical anonymization and religious absolution creates layered humor."
  rating: 6

- text: "The seven layers of the OSI model are nothing compared to the seven layers of denial I go through when my internet goes down: 'It's fine,' 'Just a hiccup,' 'Maybe if I restart,' 'WHY GOD WHY,' 'I'll call support,' 'They're useless anyway,' and finally 'I'll just use mobile data and cry.'"
  explanation: "This creates a parallel between the technical OSI seven-layer network model and the psychological stages of grief/denial, showing the emotional journey of losing internet connectivity. The escalation and specificity make it relatable and funny."
  rating: 9

- text: "I told my router I loved it. It didn't respond. Turns out I wasn't in range."
  explanation: "This short joke combines relationship language with technical WiFi terminology. The double meaning of 'in range' (emotionally available vs. within WiFi signal range) creates a perfect punchline with economy of words."
  rating: 8

- text: "The internet is the only place where you can be simultaneously connected to millions of people and still feel completely alone, usually because they're all buffering too."
  explanation: "This philosophical observation about internet connectivity and human connection takes a dark turn with the technical punchline about buffering. It combines social commentary with technical reality, creating humor through the unexpected pivot from deep to mundane."
